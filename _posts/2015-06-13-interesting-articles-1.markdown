Today I called my parents.

I told them being an adult is so boring. You wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, do the assigned tasks, eat lunch, go to meetings, come home, work out/watch TV, eat dinner, surf the internet and go to sleep.

Repeat.

I guess one good thing that came out of all this seemingly free time I have is that I've been reading more. Not necessarily books--although I should finish reading "Around the World in 50 Years" and "Infinite Jest" before the summer is over--but the news. I get daily newsletters from the Skimm, Quartz, and NextDraft.

Before I forget about the articles and store them in Pocket and never check until I no longer have WiFi, I'm going to try to write about the interesting I read recently.

**[HOW THE RED CROSS RAISED HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR HAITI AND BUILT SIX HOMES](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email)**




The piece by ProPublica and NPR was released on June 3, pointing out the utter failures of Red Cross and nonprofit/volunteer organizations roles in recovery. It's crazy to think that Red Cross remains the "charity of choice for ordinary Americans and corporations alike after natural disasters" despite their pattern of botched delivery of aid.




The biggest problem was lack of expertise. How an aid organization does not have _expertise _is beyond me. Sure, each developing country presents its own set of problems and limitations such as the land title system in Haiti. But where are the anthropologists, policy makers, project managers, and engineers to work within the system and serve the community they were called, and _paid, _to help?




The article also reveals Red Cross's financial struggles that led to mismanagement and death of real people that could have been prevented. Still, the biggest shame is the failure to utilize the local work force, creating a system of foreign aid dependency while overpaying "volunteers" and "experts" who know nothing about the local culture, and most devastatingly continuing to build an environment where structural violence traps victims of disasters.




**[ALL YOUR CLOTHES ARE MADE WITH EXPLOITED LABOR](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/patagonia-labor-clothing-factory-exploitation/394658/?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email)**




John Oliver covered child labor, specifically highlighting the failures of clothing companies to prevent human trafficking. To a certain extent, from working at Seattle Against Slavery, and from reading articles in the past, I knew about these practices and was conscious in my buying decisions, when the information was readily available. That isn't to say I actively boycotted certain brands or looked to make the situation better.




It is highly discouraging to hear that even companies like Patagoina, who prided itself on its social responsibility and stopping illegal human labor, found internal audits that detail continued abuses within its supply chain.




Two disheartening quotes:





<blockquote>

> 
> Labor trafficking is a huge problem globally. There really isn't any industry that is immune to this problem.
> 
> 

> 
> All of these suppliers are desperately trying to find ways to cut costs. The only thing they have substantial control over is labor.

**[INDIA IS BUILDING MILLIONS OF TOILETS, BUT THAT'S THE EASY PART](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-is-building-millions-of-toilets-but-toilet-training-could-be-a-bigger-task/2015/06/03/09d1aa9e-095a-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email)**




When I went to CGIU, there were tons of groups providing easy, sanitary solutions such as portable 3D printed toilets to address this issue. But perhaps everyone failed to see this problem holistically.




Building cheap, small toilets inside the house sounds like a great idea to stop people from using public fields. Without tangible incentives to the villagers, however, toilets now just stand as a symbol of unwanted gifts.




Failures on our part:




1) Campaigns promoting the use of toilets as key to women's security --> perception that toilets are just for women




2) Lack of other infrastructure. Small pits fill up quickly that emptying it becomes a nuisance. The sanitary benefits don't outweigh the convenience the factor to these villagers.




3) Continued effects of the caste system: emptying the pit is associated with tasks that only the "untouchables" would do.
