title: Safari & Wazungu
category: travel
---

I have two new favorite words: ngombe (cow) and wazungu (foreigners). This weekend, we had the ultimate wazungu experience: going to Ngorongoro Crater and Tanagire for safari trip. The trip itself was actually more expensive than I anticipated, but previous EWH groups have said you get what you pay for so despite the heavy price tag, we went with Gosheni Adventures for a two-day excursion.

In the morning, the safari jeeps came to TCDC to pick us up. I should have chosen my driver more carefully. (Tip for anyone else going on big group tours: always go with the head speaker because he will likely always lead the jeeps and you will be less covered in dirt/dust and have better views on the animals.) Comfortably packed into the jeep, we headed towards Ngorongoro Crater.

When we reached the entrance (top of the crater), fog had encompassed the whole region. The fog and cold weather rather made me feel as if I was in the Cascade Mountains, not in an African safari. This is where Bad Luck Ari struck first. Within five minutes of driving into the ranges, his jeep broke down in the middle road and refused to start for 20 minutes. The other two jeeps went ahead without us, and we were stuck in our jeep eating our snacks.

* Random comment: all of the jeeps here are Toyota brand. I’m not sure why that is.

Once the jeep was fixed, we soon reached a lookout point. The fog was so dense, however, that we could not really see the crater easily. The guide reassured us that this weather is apt for rhino sightings, but only thing I could think about was Bad Luck Ari hovering over the entire safari trip. Here’s a before and after picture of the crater with and without the fog.

Thankfully, as we descended into the crater, the fog cleared up. Actually the clouds were just hovering over the top of the crater. The ring of cloud and lushness of the forest, clashing with the vast sea of dry grass and dirt made for a surreal scene.

The first animal we encountered was an ostrich. Before I go on, please excuse the terrible quality of these photos, since they were taken with my cell phone. I will steal some pictures from Jasper and Paul who had super nice cameras.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_123404.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-195" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_123404.jpg?w=300" alt="20140628_123404" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
As we moved further down to the crater, we were greeted by herds of bison. Some were peacefully grazing, while others were mating. From a far distance, we spotted a black rhinoceros. Even with binoculars, it was hard to distinguish the rhinoceros, but apparently someone had captured a good picture of it so I’ll be looking forward to dropbox uploads.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_125556.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-196" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_125556.jpg?w=300" alt="20140628_125556" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10459092_10152562588101178_943056307462268962_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-197" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10459092_10152562588101178_943056307462268962_o.jpg?w=300" alt="10459092_10152562588101178_943056307462268962_o" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
Next, we were greeted by lions. First, a female lion napping alongside a riverbank, then a couple walking along the road. The lions didn’t mind the jeeps surrounding them; they slowly walked along the road with jeeps tailgating them. This was when I regretted being on my jeep, since our driver was so nice that he let all the other jeeps pass and get a better view of the lion.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10428106_10152562589401178_1795874793283332372_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-198" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10428106_10152562589401178_1795874793283332372_o.jpg?w=300" alt="10428106_10152562589401178_1795874793283332372_o" width="300" height="200" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10497904_10152562591776178_8344861423362474838_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-199" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10497904_10152562591776178_8344861423362474838_o.jpg?w=300" alt="10497904_10152562591776178_8344861423362474838_o" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;">After following the lion for hours, we drove off towards the lake/swamp for lunch. In the water, hippos swam around, making loud noises. Zebras roamed all around us, while the birds preyed on chances to snatch bread crumbs away from us. After taking millions of Facebook profile picture, we enjoyed our American/Tanzanian lunch along the swamp. The view was absolutely breathtaking: the humongous tree, hippos in the water, dry grass, beautiful clouds, and luscious mountains.</span>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_142338.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_142338.jpg?w=300" alt="20140628_142338" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_150353.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-201" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_150353.jpg?w=300" alt="20140628_150353" width="300" height="225" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;">As the sun began to set, we drove up the crater again and headed towards Mosquito River to spend the night. I initially thought that we were spending the night at the crater, but the campsite was actually in a small town between Ngorongoro Crater and Tanagire. Along the way, we got to see Lake Manyanmara as well.</span>After lunch, we entered into more forest-y area in the crater. Wildebeests and zebras crossed the roads and grazed on the dry grass. In the distance, male elephants were slowly walking around. Colorful birds nested on thorny trees that seemed to have more thorns that cactus and blackberry bushes combined.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_160027.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-202" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140628_160027.jpg?w=300" alt="20140628_160027" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
The campsite was more like a resort. There was a pool, nice tents with mattresses inside, bars with pool tables, and even free wifi. I did not expect such nice accommodations. I planned on not showering and freezing out in the cold. Instead, we were greeted by people bringing us wet towels to clean off the dust on our faces. The very-African dinner, as the cook described, and the epic penalty shootout between Brazil and Chile paled in comparison to the birthday celebration that ensued. According to the Danish, once a man turns 25 and is single, his friends pours cinnamon powder at them. As we sat around the pool, using our headlamps as a campfire, the Danish people ambushed Alex (our on the ground coordinator) with three bottles of cinnamon powder. Thankfully, Alex took it kindly and continued to celebrate his birthday together underneath the stars (we even saw a shooting star).

<p style="text-align:center;">- - -</p>
On the second day, we drove to Tanagire National Park. Tanagire, known for its elephants, was much larger than Ngorongoro. Huge baobab trees, which I've only seen on roller coaster tycoon (so nerdy of me I know), and a lot of unknown scrubs covered the park.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140629_110158.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-204" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140629_110158.jpg?w=300" alt="20140629_110158" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
After driving past endless herds of zebras and wildebeests, we spotted some giraffes. Our tour guide explained to us that zebras actually also eat grass on the ground, contrary to popular belief that they only munch on leaves on tall trees.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140629_111235.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-205" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140629_111235.jpg?w=300" alt="20140629_111235" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
Nearby the giraffes, warthogs roamed around clumsily. Something about them was bit awkward. Perhaps it was the way the walked or how they bent their knees to feed on the grass; regardless, they became mine, and many others', favorite animal.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10382588_10152562599511178_7329188502417619303_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-206" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/10382588_10152562599511178_7329188502417619303_o.jpg?w=300" alt="10382588_10152562599511178_7329188502417619303_o" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
Deeper into the park, we finally found groups of elephants drinking nearby streams, devouring tons of grass, and taking off the bark of the baobab trees. Although the guide told us that African elephants are bigger than Asian elephants, the ones I saw seemed smaller than the ones I rode in Thailand.

Tanagire lived up to its reputation. There were so many elephants that we eventually lost our fascination over them. People stopped taking pictures and began to play with grasshoppers that somehow made its way onto our jeep--Sofie ended up squishing it though :(
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140629_120032.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-209" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140629_120032.jpg?w=225" alt="20140629_120032" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
At this point, people were slowing becoming tired. Hunger won over the gorgeous views of the savanna and the wild animals. Jason even mistook Tyler's camera strap as a bracelet, asking him, "Hey, where did you buy that bracelet?"

The safari tour ended abruptly after lunch. With clear views of Mt. Meru and Kilimanjaro in front of our eyes, we all fell asleep on the ride home. In all, I think two days was more than enough for the safari tour. Personally, I think going to a safari is an one-time thing. Don't get me wrong. I liked the animals and the breathtaking view that struck me with awe. But after seeing zebras and wildebeests everywhere, the aura of exoticness and excitement quickly wore off. I would have wished to have seen more rhinos and even the moving sand. Also, if I have a chance to go to Serengeti, I hope to sleep inside the park in an not-so-nice tent to get the "full experience." Still, I'm grateful for this weekend and the opportunity to just be in Africa.

Note for future EWH participants if you are reading this: I recommend Gosheni Adventures if you are willing to pay for a nice two-day tour. Last year's group apparently used the same company as well.
