## Flight and Arrival

After flying Southwest domestically for so long, riding Delta internationally was much of an upgrade. The seats were bit bigger, comfortable, and the movie selection was not terrible, which was a surprise. To adjust to the time in Tanzania, I tried to sleep through much of the flight. I managed to get some naps in, interrupted only by frequent snacks/beverages. The food, to my surprise, was actually pretty good. I was expecting PB&amp;J sandwiches once, but they fed as way too often and in the end I just wanted to sleep.

My flight was delayed about 45 minutes, which gave me a small window once I landed in Amsterdam. There weren’t that many panels with flight information so I overheard some family also going to Kilimanjaro and ran to that gate. Thankfully, Zohaib was waiting at the gate and Jenny, whose flight from JFK was cancelled, had arrived as well. Ari’s flight had like 20 minutes of layover time in Amsterdam so we were planning on faking a heart attack if Ari couldn’t make it. As time ticked on by, we were even thinking of what to do if Ari came late…but Ari came just in time to get on the flight to Kilimanjaro. The four of us, wearing our purple EWH shirts, looked like some high school band kids on a trip.

I was supposed to stay up on the flight to Kilimanjaro, but as soon as I started reading The Amazing Adventure of Kavalier and Clay, I fell asleep (It’s actually a really good book though). The flight itself was uneventful, so I’ll skip to when we got to Tanzania.

The first thing I noticed was darkness. From the airplane, I could barely notice the lights. Even when I went to Myanmar, it wasn’t this bad. Customs went quickly, but Jennie and Ari’s bags were lost. We met up with the group from Denmark who had arrived an hour earlier and headed to TCDC (our school).

I met up with Jason, my roommate, and my host mama. She is a really nice Christian woman with two kids. The house was better than I expected as well. No wifi and squatty potty, but electricity is fairly reliable and her food was excellent. Over tea, she noticed that I prayed before meals, and talked about our religion. She had lost her husband a year ago to an heart attack and have been relying on prayer and support from her church members to live on. Her positive attitude and her fortitude was both admirable yet bit sad as she kept repeating, “life must go on.”

Tomorrow is the start of our trip! Looking forward to learning some Swahili and the culture here!

## First Day of Classes

I had another crazy dream. I’m not sure if it is the malaria pill giving me such thoughts or me just remembering my already-crazy dreams more vividly. Either way, I could not fall asleep easily. When I did, I felt like I was awake, not quite lucid dreaming, but just stuck in a phase between being awake and dreaming.

I heard people scream <em>goal</em> from the local bar behind our house, the Muslim prayer call in the morning from the mosque, and Jason snoring...constantly. I woke up eventually around 6:50 and took my first cold shower.

For breakfast, we had some toast and fresh fruit. Mangos were bit sour, but the bananas and green oranges were delicious nonetheless. Talking to Mama Glory, I notice some things:
<ul>
    <li>Mosquitoes/bugs are not that rampant (perhaps it’s because it’s the winter/dry season)</li>
    <li>There is a strange mix between Muslims and Christians in Arusha. The Christian representation is stronger; near the coast, Muslim population is bigger.</li>
    <li>There was also some tension between Tanzanians and Kenyans as my host mother said, “Tanzanians are really friendly unlike Kenyans.”</li>
    <li>Cold showers aren't too bad at the homestay</li>
</ul>
Arjan and Mathias actually came to pick us up. I had to carry my bag of tools and walked to TCDC, which was about 20-30 minute walk. First day of classes went well. Besides the introduction, the pace of the class was fairly fast. We learned about the noun classes and basic pronunciation in Swahili. I definitely have to review once I get home tonight and make an effort to memorize some technical words daily.

The tea break and lunch was really nice….mainly because I got to use wifi and finally tell my parents that I’m alive and well. The wifi at TCDC is sufficiently fast; it’s good enough to torrent Game of Thrones finale.

After lunch, the engineering part of the lecture was cut short due to lack of supplies. Alex (on-the-ground-coordinator) said it will pick up fast in the upcoming weeks. I will end today’s blog with a random fact and review of what I learned in class.

Random fact of the day: If you run out of gel for the ECG, ketchup works well as a temporary replacement.

Swahili Lessons:

Kiswahili (informally known as Swahili) is made up of 60% Bantu (recognizable by the suffix “a” in verbs), 30% Arabic, and 10% of others such as German, Portuguese, English.

<p style="text-align:center;">Typical Mucky Weather</p>

## First Engineering Lab

My roommate Jason woke up at 5:30 to head to the gym to work out. I have no clue why someone would make such a decision. I woke up relatively early as well, around 6:30, ate breakfast, and walked to TCDC around 7:30. On the way, I was about to pass someone when the man started to talk to me. He tried to speak English while I failed to even greet him properly in Swahili. I probably shouldn’t walk alone though. He kept asking for more: my number, where I lived, and other sketchy things.

The second day in class went by a lot quicker. We learned the verb conjugations and how to count to 100. The pace significantly slowed down as we practiced simple concepts repeatedly. I missed playing bingo and passing around the ball to learn something...only if engineering lectures at Duke were that easy. The frequent breaks including the crucial tea breaks helped us get through the long 8:30 to 5:30 day.

Today during lunch we got together as a group and played volleyball. I think everyone is getting closer. The Danish kids are definitely outgoing and the few non-Duke, non-Danish kids have strong personalities as well. It was only the second day together, but from this outlook, we seem to get along fine for the next two months.

After lunch, we learned about ventilators from Larry. I’m not sure how useful these lectures are. It would be much better if we had videos recording the repair process. I can’t really relate to what Larry is saying yet. Everything seems so theoretical at the moment. I hope BME 354 isn’t this way… But during the actual lab time, we individually built an extension cord. The concept behind it was simple, but the execution itself required some dexterity. From stripping wires to screwing them in to making makeshift stress reliefs, everything required some special care. I also learned that to activate the sockets here, the ground node has to be plugged in first to open up the live and neutral wires.

I’m falling asleep after a tiring day. Maybe playing basketball wore me out. The dinner today wasn’t special: Tanzania style bread (similar to Indian pan), plain spaghetti, bean soup, and cabbage mixture.

## Dala Dala Adventure

I think I’m stuck in a stage called “perpetual tiredness” in the culture shock progression…or maybe it is because I watched the Game of Thrones episode I torrented last night.

Swahili lesson today was a drag. We were learning some basic grammar, but people were asking questions beyond what we were covering that really slowed the pace down. Instead of focusing on the lesson itself, I just looked forward to the tea/break times. Apparently it isn’t rude to eat during these times, so I’m regretting not bringing granola bars/beef jerky to Tanzania.

The whole day, everyone was hyped about a big soccer game they planned. Apparently we are practicing before the MSU kids get here and want to challenge them on EWH vs. MSU showdown or something. Engineering lectures were boring and soldering just took forever. I really hate the wet sponge/solder mix smell. I hope my fixes at the hospitals don’t involve intense soldering.

Today wasn’t much a special day, but after playing soccer or futbol, I took the dala dala home for the first time. It’s like a modified minivan that is crammed with people. It reminded me of the minibuses we used to take in Thailand. The price for a 5 minute ride/30 minute walking distance is like 300-400 shillings, equivalent of a quarter.

Also, at night, we finally learned enough Swahili to tackle the local bars. I tried one of the local beers, tasted like Guiness, and watched the Netherlands vs. Australia and Spain vs. Chile game together. The bar had a small TV, but at least 20 people were crowding it. Lyon and his homestay brother came over from TCDC to hang out. Lyon’s homestay brother, unnamed to protect his identity, talked about how much weed he smokes. It’s funny how certain <em>recreational</em> activities are common no matter where you go.

<p style="text-align:center;">Pretending like we know how to solder</p>

## Monkeys

We just walked back from TCDC in the dark to our homestay after listening to Alex’s story about how one of the people in the EWH-Nicaragua program got mugged walking back drunk. The walk back was pleasant nonetheless; we got to talk to our Swahili teacher along the way.

I think I have gotten into the routine of going to class, playing sports, hitting up the bar for a quick drink, and heading home/watching world cup. Swahili lessons are picking up the pace. We can form basic sentences…when we have the grammar chart in front of us. I can still only greet people and listen with blank stares and say kwaheri (good bye).

The engineering lecture was really simple today. We went over Ohm’s law and how to use the multimeter. I’m working with a BME Danish student and a Chem major so I guess all the circuitry and electronics stuff will be mine to fix at the hospitals.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140619_163527.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-53" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140619_163527.jpg?w=225" alt="20140619_163527" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
The sight of monkeys, excitement over the scenery, and the general euphoria of being in a foreign country is slowly going away. Hopefully tomorrow at the hospital I can find that sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

## Church

Mama Glory attends a Lutheran church nearby. Although Jason and I couldn’t speak any Swahili beyond the basic greetings and counting numbers, we had a nice man, Paul, translate for us. The formalities of the service were vastly different than what I was used to.

First, I noticed that the women sat on the left side while the men sat on the right side. It was ironic later on as the pastor emphasized the importance of unity. However, I cannot solely explain that by gender norms here. The role of the pastor was distributed among four pastors. There were women pastors who led offering, prayer, and various readings of passages.

Also, there was a huge emphasis on offering. The call to offering is very public and people give twice. Also, after the offering, the pastors ask for some funds to carry out their projects. The amount given and the names of the people who give are written in a log. After service, there was an auction for the items donated by the ones who could not afford to give. I guess that was a huge difference than services I was used to. It may be a pragmatic approach to religion replacing community.

The sermon itself was very short. The main pastor talked about how unity brings blessings. The passages were in Mark and Corinthians somewhere, but they read so fast in Swahili that I could not keep up.

*Although it is dry season here, it has been raining a lot. All the muddy roads have made me appreciate the asphalt/cement roads so much more.

In the afternoon, we went back to downtown Arusha to celebrate Mathias’s 23<sup>rd</sup> birthday. We ate at the Mexican restaurant nearby Empire Sports Bar, visited the Masai market—where we met KingJames (real name with valid ID) and DJ Peace who tried to buy us weed—and meandered around town. DJ Peace rapped Wu-Tang and Biggie with us, but ended up following us to the dala dala station, where he “sold us” the coffee bracelet.

After a packed dala dala ride (29-ish people), we met in USA River to continue celebrating Mathias’s birthday. We downed 3 kgs of local baked chicken and continued talking until midnight. It was nice to get to know the Danish people and some non-Duke kids at this time.

## Routine

It’s already been a week since I’ve been in Tanzania. Everything is settling down; routines are forming; and the euphoria is slowing setting away. Each day starts with Swahili lessons where we review homework and the topics we learned the day before. After short breaks, we learn new concepts, proceeded by the much needed tea breaks. Now there is a group from MSU, Northwestern, and Ohio area, making the place lively but slowing down the internet (I was able to torrent Suits nonetheless). Swahili lessons end with dialogue practice. Today, we learned about haggling and buying basic groceries at the market. It’s so easy to think of American prices, we ended up getting <em>Mzungu</em> prices where the vendors inflate the cost to as much as quadruple the local or Tanzanian price.

After lunch break, we listen to Larry’s engineering lectures. It’s really hard to visualize them, and the recurring theme is lack of resources or expertise to actually fix the equipment. This is bit discouraging, but hopefully as time goes on it will get better. In lab so far, we covered basic electronic parts (LEDS, diodes, resistors) and made simple circuits to get accustomed to soldering.

Once labs are done, we either play basketball, soccer, or volleyball until sunset. We stopped walking home since we figured paying 200 shillings (about 12 cents) for a short ride home is safer and faster than walking in darkness for 20-30 minutes. At home, we usually just wash up, eat dinner, and finish homework. Last week, we were still bit jetlagged so went to sleep right away, but starting this week, we will go out for a bit before heading to bed for another day.

I hope I’m not just settling into a routine here. I don’t want this trip to be extended version of summer school in a different country.

***

Later at night, there was an extended power outage, so we sat around the dinner table, relying on candlelight for a long time. We had an interesting conversation about marriage, divorce, Lebron James, and feminism in Africa…more about this later.

## Market and Power Source

<p class="separator">In the morning, I had a meaningful conversation with Mama Glory about starting her own business. She used to work for TCDC, but when the principal changed, she wasn't happy with the pay so she decided to quit. She started by selling food at the veranda, but it wasn't paying off. With a friend, she then opened up a stationary shop (where people can print and laminate pages), but due to stiff competition, they closed down within a year. She finally took an idea from her friend and starting selling beans. Now she has her own shop, but she told me that as she ages, it is hard to take care of the shop despite it making good business.</p>
<p class="separator">At TCDC, we got to practice our Swahili at the Tengeru Market. We were all given 2000 shillings (about $1.25) to buy as much groceries as possible. We were all warned about the mzungu price where they would try to inflate the prices, but the people there actually gave fair prices and felt disrespected went we kept trying to haggling with them. Everything was so cheap and fresh. I got a decently big watermelon, five avocados, bag of hot peppers, couple of cucumbers, and garlic for less than $2.</p>
<p class="separator">Engineering lab today was bit complicated as we built a power source. Below are pictures of the power source and the LED flashlight we made couple of days ago.</p>

## Compassion & Engagement Party

After a proper Fourth of July celebration, I spent my entire Saturday with my host family. My host Mama works part time as a teacher on Saturdays at Compassion International – Makumira Division. Since I have been sponsoring Bassirou through Compassion, the director at the Makumira Division wanted me to visit and talk to the sponsored children and tour the facility.

Early in the morning, the children received basic education along with Bible classes. After briefly introducing myself in broken Swahili, I sat through my host Mama’s class on ethics amidst the children repeatedly whispering, “Mzungu, Mchina…” During chai break, I met with the director to discuss the vision of Compassion and how funds were being used. The director previously worked at World Vision in Dar es Salaam as the financial manager. He explained how he planned to use his expertise and experience to expand classes on technology and carpentry. After chai, the children broke off into their concentration classes (art, English, music, computer skills, etc), while I had a chance to meet the pastor to pray for all the 239 children on this campus. Overall, I was extremely happy to see that Compassion, at least in Makumira, was holding true to its mission.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_110620.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-169" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_110620.jpg?w=225" alt="20140705_110620" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
If anyone is considering sponsoring a child, I recommend Compassion! I would also be happy to discuss in detail what my experience has been like.
<p style="text-align:center;">- - -</p>
As I finished my visit at Compassion early in the morning, Mama Glory invited me to attend her niece’s engagement party. I originally planned on joining the rest of my team at St. Jude’s International School for a volunteering event, but I wanted to experience traditional Tanzanian engagement party.

The party was held in Kisenge, on the other side of Arusha, facing Mt. Meru. Although the party was supposed to begin at two, when we arrived at 1:45, the maids at the house were still setting up. Mama Glory explained how the families were still discussing dowry and wedding details.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_182943.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-170" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_182943.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_182943" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
Mama Glory’s brother’s house was enormous. I imagined a small house like Mama Glory’s, but it seemed like her brother (the eldest) had inherited a large amount of wealth. The house, surrounded by a small banana farm, had a huge yard, a guesthouse, and a fancy main building that was newly renovated. The grand children each had the newest smartphones (Galaxy S5, iPhone, HTC One) that made me look outdated with the Galaxy S3.

<a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_150421.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-171 aligncenter" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_150421.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_150421" width="300" height="225" /></a>

Being the only mzungu at a huge Tanzanian party of about 100 people, I started to regret my decision to come to the party. As more family members, in-laws, and neighbors passed by, I awkwardly greeted them and tried to carry on a conversation in Swahili. To make matter worse, Mama Glory had to attend a family meeting and Tanzanian attitude of pole-pole (slow) pushed the start of the engagement party to 4:30-ish. At some point, this man speaking some English asked me if I wanted to marry his daughter…I almost got wifed up in Tanzania.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_175015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-172" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_175015.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_175015" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
Once the party began, I had such a blast. When all the guests had arrived, the pastor opened with a prayer and a sermon. Then, the MC took over to introduce every single guest at the place. The MC liked to joke around with the family. Apparently, Mama Glory’s mother was named Ruth. Mama Glory also has a sister, niece, grandniece, and sister-in-law all named Ruth. So each of them would try to confuse the guests by trying to act like the other person.

When it came time to introduce me, the MC asked me to say my name. I didn’t really understand, so I replied, “Bwana Yesu sefui (not sure the spelling of it),” which means “Praise Lord Jesus, since everyone else had been introducing themselves that way. Everyone at the engagement party laughed, and the MC joked that mzungus can have weird names.

After a long introduction, it was time to reveal the bride. All the women in the family went up to the front and danced around two women wearing nearly identical clothes. Then, each of them began claiming that they were the bride, while the MC joked around saying how some of them were so old they could be his grandmother.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_165146.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-175" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_165146.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_165146" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
As the music died down, the groom appeared from the back. He first had to prove himself by showing everyone the ring. Once the guests approved of him and his ring, he could then approach his real bride and propose to her. This ceremony took place amidst all the guests dancing and singing aloud around them.

Finally, around 5:30, “lunch” was served. Strangely, the other woman wearing the same clothes as the bride kept following around the newly engaged couple. I wasn’t sure why, but my guess was that she was like the Maid of Honor. The lunch portions were massive.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-174 aligncenter" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_154013.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_154013" width="300" height="225" />

I had two plates of the food pictured above. Mama Glory explained that at such parties, it was a disgrace if the guests did not have food leftover, so they handed out massive portions.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_165339.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-173" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_165339.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_165339" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
The party ensued with continued blessings from all the guests. Each guest went up to the front to give some money or gifts, and then danced around. The MC made each side of the family have some sort of a dance battle. It was really amusing to watch.

As the sun began to set, the party died down quickly. Although the music and the dancing continued, the pastor officially closed the engagement festivities with a prayer and asked the guests to shake hands with the newly engaged before heading off.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_175621.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-176" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140705_175621.jpg?w=300" alt="20140705_175621" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
When the music finally died down, the sun had already set. By the end, I felt part of the family—at least, less mzungu-ish. I was blessed by the invitation to share such a tradition.

Now I want a Tanzanian-style engagement party when I get engaged.

## Reflection & Random Thoughts

*** This blog post isn’t necessarily in chronological order.

Before I talk about my reflections and thoughts on Tanzanian culture, I just want to say that I’m extremely proud of myself for fixing my iPod charger/USB plug. I felt like an actual engineer, pulling apart the broken cord, soldering the loose connection, and heat shrinking/electrical taping everything back together.

Since I go to bed around 11PM, I have been waking up early, leaving plenty of time to talk to my host mom over breakfast. First, Mama Glory wanted me to pray for John as he is going off to boarding school this upcoming Sunday. She was concerned about his lack of concentration, his friend group, losing faith, and other general concerns that any parent of a boy going through puberty would have. This started a whole spill about education and gender roles.

Tanzanian education is dominated by private institutions. All higher learning institutions are taught in English. However, only private primary schools teach in both Swahili and English. So when the children who only attended public schools—all taught in Swahili—move onto secondary schools, they are bound to fail. Also, Mama Glory described in detail how the teachers are not qualified or do not have passion for teaching. This pushed her to send John to a private institution, where he will study to become a civil engineer.

John’s older sister is actually graduating from college this year with a degree/concentration in insurance. Mama Glory wanted her to study medicine or education for better job prospects, but didn’t want to force her into studying something that she did not enjoy. Anyways, the fact that women are getting proper education and having somewhat of equal employment opportunities in Tanzania, or rather Africa in general, surprised me. It shattered my prejudice on oppression of women and gender roles in Tanzania.

Looking back though, I have noticed the subtle power of women in Tanzania. Although Tanzania is very much patriarchal still, the role of Mama’s, at least in the house, is significant. Perhaps, it is because Mama Glory is a single mother who has supported her entire family throughout the years. Or it could be because we are visitors and can’t fully grasp how family/gender roles work here yet. But I expected to see most women be traditional housewives: cooking, cleaning, and staying at home. But the Mama’s here have a legitimate profession (teacher, business owner, cook), and getting married isn’t the only thing for them in their life. In fact, the principal of TCDC is also a Tanzanian lady!

I’m not sure though. Still, gender roles are clearly defined. The women cook, clean, and do the dishes. Yesterday, Jason and I wanted to clean the room. We wanted to just change the sheets and take out the garbage. However, Mama Glory basically told the girl helping her with the business to sweep &amp; mop the floor, change the linens for us, and also organize our clothes. I’ve also heard stories at hospitals that doctors refused to talk to female EWH participants.

One of the past EWH participants, Rebecca, came to visit the class on Wednesday. After spending time at the hospital, she decided to stay in Tanzania for good. She met an engineer who designed fluoride water filters using animal bones. In Tanzania, the fluoride content in running water is extremely high that the teeth and bones become brittle over time. The water filter was not only cheap and simple to produce, but also sustainable as well.

She now works at a solar panel company while working on building rainwater collection systems at schools through the local rotary club. On a side note, I was bit skeptical on the usefulness of solar energy at this level. Solar panels are extremely expensive to install, and are not really helping solve the energy crisis. I thought it was only intensifying the social hierarchy.

Anyways, it was amazing to listen to her story of becoming integrated into the society. Since she is dating a tour guide, the conversation over tea naturally shifted to places to visit that weren’t so famous. She told us about this active volcano, known for the cold lava, and the basic lake with calcified animals. I think I will visit this volcano instead of climbing Mt. Meru the last weekend in the first month.

We also asked about the outlook of tourism in Tanzania. She explained how rising cost of tourism is discouraging people from visiting Africa. In her words, tourists would rather pay less to visit Asian countries, despite the appeal of safaris. In terms of poaching and diminishing animal population, she said that ironically hunting clubs are biggest contributors to conservation causes since they pay a hefty fee for game hunts. Still, corruption rooted deep within society was sourcing these fees for personal benefits in society rather than to fund conservation efforts.

Next year in Tanzania is election year. Mama Glory explained to us that taxes and cost of living has increased significantly due to politicians trying to raise campaign money. The constitution is also in the process of being rewritten, but corrupt politicians are taking advantage of loopholes to maintain their benefits.

This week, we didn’t have any engineering labs. Instead, we had several reflection activities. I personally thought they were a waste of time, since such discussions should occur naturally outside of class: role of volunteering, helping vs. helper, etc.

But one thought stood out to me. One of the major roles of EWH is to promote sustainability. For example, when we fix medical equipment, sometimes we choose more sustainable repairs, where the local nurses/technicians can later fix the machine (if it breaks down again) with locally available parts, rather than providing a longer lasting solution using more expensive parts that can’t be bought locally. Theoretically, sustainable solutions should help the hospitals and the community for the better. However, the culture here is to simply replace broken equipment with the next donated equipment. They often do not have funding to pay for technicians, and doctors and nurses simply don’t have time to fix the equipment. In this train of thought, how useful is a program like ours? Shouldn’t we focus more on educating the technicians and finding a way to integrate into the hospital better?

## Final Thoughts

Note: Read other Tanzania posts before preceeding

<span style="font-family:Arial;">It didn't hit me that I was actually no longer in Africa until I used my credit card to buy a can of Heineken and Toblerone in Amsterdam. The end came much quicker than expected and was anticlimactic as it could be. People trickled out of TCDC throughout the day as the bonfire slowly died out.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">It is hard to describe this experience in simple terms--not in the cliche way, but because it was so different than what I had prepared myself for. I had anticipated challenges with language/culture and technical fixes. Well, I did encounter some of those, but cultural lessons came mostly from interacting with the Danes rather than the Tanzanians (not to undermine the ample opportunity I had to "immerse" myself in their culture) and technical problems were...polarizing: they were either too easy or unable to be fixed at all.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">So what did I gain? A respite from the hectic, directionless life back home? Time of introspection to close out first two years of college? Or a fun time in Tanzania with amazing people? It is hard to say.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">I can definitively say that I changed though. Perhaps this trip is my bildungsroman, story about a sheltered, privileged, naive boy whose ideals have been shattered by reality. It sounds depressing, but it isn't necessarily.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">All this isn't to say that I regret going on EWH trip to Tanzania. I really did have fun. I couldn't have asked for a better group who bonded so fast and had as much fun, whether it was grabbing a beer and watching the world cup or hiking or swimming in the ocean together.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">The best memory this trip was definitely summiting Ol Doinyo Lengai, while the most satisfying moment was when we heard that through our training, premature babies will now be treated at St. Joseph's Hospital instead of being sent to KCMC.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">If I were to do this trip over again, I would spend more time with my homestay and try to talk more with the doctors at the hospital. It was hard in Huruma since there was no official chai break or designated lunch time. Also, I would have liked to work more in KCMC or Health Science Technology Center with Jurom. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">
</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Lastly, some word of advice of for future participants: </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">1) Bring more cash: ATM fees are ridiculous and excursions are expensive. I ended up spending around $1000 - 1500 overall. Also, bring $100 for the EWH stipend if you don't want to go to ATM later to take out money, pay the transfer fee, just to be reimbursed later. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">2) If you are bringing a toolkit, consider buying extra batteries, duck tape, and a better screwdriver/soldering iron. It'll save you time going shopping for parts and being frustrated over stripped screws/barely functioning soldering iron.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;">3) Be annoying in Swahili class. They don't teach you the technical terms, so be persistent in asking specific questions. Save them to your computer and have a copy for off-line access. </span>
