*** I forgot to write in my blog this week so I'm just writing a quick summary of what happened

I felt like a OTGC (on the ground coordinator) this week, traveling to different hospitals in Moshi. After finishing up work on Monday, we went over to KCMC doctor's compound in Moshi to print out the quick-start guides for the incubators at St. Joseph's Hospital. When we arrived late at night, KCMC people were still doing work, fixing up a broken ECG cable inside their house. I wondered why they gave KCMC people two hospitals to work on, while sending the three of us to work at Huruma where there wasn't much work.

The next morning, we met at St. Joseph's Hospital with Alex and Jurom to train the nurses in the labor ward about how to operate the incubators. There was one nurse who was very fluent in English who quickly picked up the lesson and taught others in Swahili as well. It seemed more effective to go through the guide first, then letting the nurses go through it themselves with the quick-start guides.

After the training, we went over to Jurom's workshop to work on pulse oximeters. The problem with most of these was broken finger probes: weak light, faulty sensor, and stripped wires. Considering the significant need for these at our hospital, I plan on working on developing cheaper and perhaps self-assembly enabled kit of pulse oximeters/finger probes for the upcoming EWH competition. In the US, finger probes are merely $20, but they were really hard to find in the developing world.

Anyways, I accidentally forgot my tool kit at KCMC and since I didn't have much work at Huruma, I decided to stay an extra day with the KCMC crew, while Jason and Sofie went back. That night, I got to visit the surgical ward with David and Ashley and worked on some anesthesia machines. From what I saw that night, KCMC equipment mostly had plumbing issues (tubing, leaks, etc) rather than electrical/mechanical ones that we've experienced at Huruma.

The following morning I mostly worked with KJ at Mawenzi Hospital, which barely had any equipment. Here the problem was missing parts: lightbulb for the microscope, skin probe for the infant warmer, and missing rods for the examination screens. While looking for the lightbulb in town, we cut up a metal tube/rod and sanded it down to retrofit for the screens. Also, without epoxy or super glue, we had to resort to duck tape to secure the screens. In the end, it didn't look too awful, but some joints were unable to fold anymore.

Since last weekend everyone met up in Moshi, this week people convened at Arusha. The original plan had been to go camping at Lake Diluti on Friday, but due to poor planning and bad weather, it was postponed til Saturday. This unexpected change brought everyone to the big apartment in Arusha, shared by Mt. Meru and St. Elizabeth's kids for a huge house party.

On Saturday, no one still knew whether or not camping was happening. In fact, we didn't figure out until 9 PM that night. Regardless, most of us headed to the lake to ride the canoes and sit in the hammock. There was only one boat available for use, so I didn't get to go in the water until later at night. We did find a trail around the lake, however, that I want to walk around in the future. Also, for whoever is staying with Mama Glory, she has some contacts who owns a house by the lake, so perhaps future groups can stay there.

At night, while others sat around the bonfire, Mikkel and I were able to take the boat out into the lake. Listening to Money Trees and drifting in the middle of the lake on a sketchy boat with Mikkel was probably my favorite memory of the trip.
