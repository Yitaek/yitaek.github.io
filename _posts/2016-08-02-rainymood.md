title: Rainy Mood - Part I

It rained this morning -- and there's nothing quite like a cup of coffee on a dreary, drizzly morning in Seattle.The weather reminds me again that I am home. Graduated. Done traveling. <strike>And ready to be a "real adult."</strike> It's been a while since I wrote something on my blog. Last time was in Nepal back in January when I vowed not to go on short term service trips anymore <a href="/thoughts/2016/01/10/to-hell-with-good-intentions.html">(read here)</a>. My final semester at Duke flew by so I didn't have a chance to properly reflect on and thank everyone along the way. But thanks to Ashley and all the people who donated, this video popped up on my newsfeed, prompting me to write again.

It ironic because I didn't donate to Pratt so i didn't even get an email from them. In fact, I had forgetten that I recorded the narration months before. While it was fun getting paid to post on Instagram with #mydukeyear twice a month, I don't think the above video really paints an accurate picture of my experience at Duke (not surprising because I had little say in the script, picture selection, and video production). So on this rainy morning, a week before I move to Baltimore to start work at Leverege and my fellowship with Venture for America, I reflect on Duke, VFA, and everything in between that was, and is, and is to come.

<h2> Duke: First Half </h2>

I remember when I failed my first ever midterm at Duke. I was sitting in my small room in Randolph that looked more like a jail cell with my freshmen year roommate, who was in the middle of a week-long binge-watching run of The Office. At first, I kept refreshing the Sakai page to see if my grade would magically change. Then I prayed for a generous curve to salvage the situation. But when the grade distribution was released, I was more distraught to learn that I was <i>below average.</i>

It was a continuous cycle of rationalization and self-doubting: Maybe I wasn't smart enough to be at Duke. <i>No, it's okay because everyone else had already taken this class in high school.</i> But I got below average. <i>It might be because I'm just an engineer in a premed-dominated class.</i> Um, but there are other BMEs in this class.

I always felt behind freshmen year. It seemed like half the people in my dorm was on a prestigious scholarship, after winning various competitions and having founded nonprofits, while the other half was either super talented in athletics or music. I'm sure this was a similar experience for most people being surrounded by amazing people in college, but coming from a unknown public high school in the suburbs of Seattle, I simply amazed to be around such talent.
