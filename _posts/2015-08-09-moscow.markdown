**_Day 1_**

Do you know what sucks when you travel?

When the airline decides to delay your flight, lose your luggage, and you are left with practically nothing.

Thanks to kind Turkish travelers, I was able to shower, but I still have no clothes to changes in, all my toiletries, and snacks that I brought. Oh well, I still have my phone, Macbook, and two books for rest of my three week trip. They found my bag in New York so I'm hoping it gets here before I leave Moscow.

I was supposed to arrive at 9:35am flying from RDU -> JFK -> SVO. However, for some reason, there was a ground stop in all incoming flights to JFK, so my flight got delayed, leaving me to take RDU -> JFK -> AMS -> SVO route and coming into Moscow at 4pm.

Well, when I arrived, I found out that they had lost my bag...so I wasted about an hour trying to locate it. Thankfully most of the people here speak basic English, so I was able to buy the Aeroexpress ticket from the airport to downtown, take the metro to Red Square, and walk to my hostel.

After randomly choosing dinner from a Russian menu (I ended up getting salmon kabab and mashed potatoes), I explored Moscow on foot. Traveling alone reminded me of the time I was in India: all the touristy places are filled with selfie sticks and annoying couples.

_**Day 2**_

A friend has said that my travel blogposts are boring and are a classic example of why people should show not tell... I will try my best to make them interesting, but it's not like I have random, deep thoughts as I am just looking at pretty buildings...

I woke up pretty early, paranoid over my lost luggage and constantly checking both Delta and KLM websites to see if there had been any updates as to where my bag was. I'm not sure if it was paranoia, uncomfortable bed, hot weather, loud snoring, or jetlag but I couldn't go back to sleep easily. I had set my alarm for 8am, but after figuring out that nothing really opens until 10am here in Moscow, I snoozed until 9:15am.

I signed up for Free Moscow Walking Tour, which began at 10:45am, so I wandered the streets for a bit looking for a supermarket while heading to Kitay-Gorod Metro Station. I wanted to find a decent breakfast place, but unable to read Russian letters (I can't seem to figure out this mix of Cyrillic and Greek alphabet), I settled on Krispy Kreme for light breakfast.

Still wearing my sweaty clothes from two days ago, I trekked to the meeting point at Slavyanskaya Square. I stayed away from big groups of people because I was cognizant of how smelly I was, and didn't want to be a nuisance. I wish I hadn't though because I was super anti-social and feeling lonely throughout the first tour.

Promptly at 10:45am, Marina showed up to give a brief city walking tour. (She was really pretty and had a British accent. Also, on a side note, all these Russian girls are really beautiful but too tall for me so not sure how I feel on the whole.) Starting at the Cyril and Methodius monument, whom Marina blamed for "shitty alphabet," we walked around the outskirts of Kitay-Gorod onto Red Square/Kremlin.




Fun fact: Kitay-Gorod refers to the wall surrounding the Moscow region. The word literally means China-town. It has nothing to do with Chinese people, but the way the bricks/wall was constructed.




On the way to Red Square, Marina explained in detail the history behind the Romanov family. They built a stone house in the middle of the fashion district, just to show off their wealth. They also had a private church next to their house, which was later donated to the monks after they became tsars and moved into the Kremlin.




Marina also shed a different light on Ivan the Terrible. Despite the fact that he decimated the entire population of Moscow (2 million to approximately half a million residents), Marina thanked him for introducing the Russian people to alcohol. From her perspective, Ivan was the original frat bro. After opening up the first embassy in Russia in attempts to get to Queen Elizabeth, he opened up the first pub in Moscow and taxed people who didn't go to pubs to drink. He also assembled secret police to enforce this. I guess if you are the tsar, you don't get in trouble for hazing.

The guy was a straight legend. After building St. Basil's Cathedral after unifying the country (side note: St. Basil's Cathedral is actually called Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat, but the man adored a homeless saint named Basil and named it after him and the other name is too long), the legend goes that he asked the architects to build him another one. When they responded with enthusiasm to build something even better, apparently he gorged their eyes out so they won't ever see anything more beautiful than St. Basil's Cathedral.




Fun fact: Red Square means beautiful square. It has nothing to do with communism movement.




As the clocktower rang 12 times, Marina explained another fun Russian tradition. For new years ceremony, friends and family gather around and before the bell stops ringing, they open, pour, and chug the champagne to make their wishes come true. Ivan made the entire countries into alcoholics.




Next, we explored GUM department store. It's funny how the building was a government department store, but now the only Russian-made thing sold their is ice cream. Also, the only people actually buying things are Asian tourists.

Last night as I was exploring on my own, I took this picture of Four Season hotel from far away. Then as I got closer I was disappointed at how all the fancy looking buildings in Moscow are hotels now except for the cathedrals. But it turns out this was used to be a famous building that's even on Stolichnaya Vodka label. Speaking of which I need to try that at some point...I did see some at the supermarket today....




The city tour ended with a visit to Lenin's Mausoleum. I was sweating so much and looking so shabby that even dead guy Lenin was dressed and looked better than me.




Overall impression of free walking city tour: definitely do it! The guides are gorgeous Russian girls and they make the tour fun (not only because of their looks, but they are legit funny, joking about Putin at times). Best of all, it's FREE (if you don't tip).

I fell asleep writing the blogpost yesterday so this might be little unorganized now....but here is what happened after the free walking tour.




Desperate for some Wifi to check for updates on my luggage, I went to an Apple Store to steal some free internet. But I ended up spending too much time figuring out which plane my bags were on and forwarding that information to my hostel people that I forgot to get a proper meal. I ended up having a crepe on the go to catch the Kremlin tour starting at 2pm (free tour ended at 1pm).




Warning: I would not spend money on Kremlin unless you want to check if off your bucket list or feel like you've actually been to Moscow.




I was thoroughly unimpressed by Kremlin. The architecture isn't even Russian! The symbol of Russia is mostly Italian-made. But then again, Statue of Liberty was a gift from France and that's the symbol of New York. Inside Kremlin, there are multiple references to double-headed eagle and stars to show the history of Russia and moving of capitals. More cathedrals, which are not impressive if you've been to Vatican City or have seen some of Peruvian churches. The only fun part was hearing about world's largest cannon and bell that have both never been used. The locals call it prime example of Russian nonsense.

In the afternoon, I followed the routes suggested for Communist Russia, going to old KGB building, locations of the political executions, Bolshoi Theater, Karl Marx Statue, etc. But I wasn't well-versed in the history behind it so it wasn't too helpful or inspiring. I would skip this and just explore Arbat Street.




As the sun began to set, I wandered into random streets of Moscow to see non-touristy places. I didn't understand how half the city was made up of luxury brand stores....like where do normal people shop?




I started from Kitay-Gorod station and went inside the Church located nearby. It is called Church in the middle of nowhere in Russian and had several interesting stories associated with it. Before Kitay-Gorod walls were broken down, apparently this church was by a swamp and was believed to be surrounded by devils. Also, during the plague, the priest saved the population from catching an even bigger epidemic by hiding an icon that was put on the walls of Kitay-Gorod, which people believed to have healing powers if you kissed it. Lastly, the church was also used as a KGB safe-room.




Following the hill just to the left of the church, there's another interesting church/cathedral that functioned as prison for female criminals. This was the place where the infamous sadist Saltykova was sentenced by Catherine the Second. Saltykova used to torture and kill her serfs. Catherine the Second couldn't execute her because Saltykova was from a royal family, but ordered her to become a nun at this church. In order to become a nun, you must go through confession, and Saltykova never confessed her sins, and legends say she would scream loudly everyday. Too bad she didn't confess and go through the shame walk like in Game of Thrones.




If you keep walking up the road, you arrive at the "ghetto" part of Russia. There's districts with lots of graffiti and sketchy roads.

But the real reason why this place is ghetto is because of a bad policy change that suddenly brought all the uneducated poor people from the rural regions into a city that was not ready to handle that much population. There were no jobs for these people, and they turned to criminal activity to survive. These people were dubbed crayfish for their nocturnal activity (although I'm not sure why crayfish is the best nickname for that).




_**Day 3**_




I was exhausted from walking around so much yesterday I snoozed until 9:30am. After checking out of my hostel and carefully putting all the directions on Evernote, I headed out to exchange more cash and visit the Tretyakov Gallery. (All this effort ended up being not useful as I forgot to sync Evernote on my phone so I didn't actually have any directions/maps saved and had to resort to asking for directions with hand-motions and drawings again.)




[![20150812_132626](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150812_132626.jpg?w=300)](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150812_132626.jpg) [![20150812_125259](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150812_125259.jpg?w=300)](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150812_125259.jpg)




The gallery takes about two hours to peruse through. I would recommend skipping through all the portraits (unless you are really interested in portraits of random people) and take more time in Ivanov section. You aren't allowed to take pictures unless you pay for them. Not much else to say about this day. I'll talk about the ride to St. Petersburg in that portion of the blog post.

_**Final Thoughts & Random Tips**_







  1. Get maps and directions in Russian. There's hardly any English signs in Moscow and if you use the free maps given in the hostels, you will never find your way around.


  2. Speaking of directions, if you get lost, look for building numbers and try to match them up with what Google Maps is telling you. Warning: If you use Metro/Walking routes, sometimes it doesn't take you to the best exit. For example, most of the stations that connect multiple lines have different metro station names per metro line, but are accessible underground if you walk. Google Maps doesn't account for this so look at the metro map and double confirm.


  3. Exchange money at local banks as you will get much better rates...like 47 rubles vs. 63 rubles per dollar.


  4. Eat at My My, pronounced Moo Moo. Cheap, Russian style canteen.


  5. When buying water, be aware of cheaper sparkling waters. I would shake the bottle to see if there's any carbonation before purchasing "water."
