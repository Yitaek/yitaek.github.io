*** I was extremely lazy and forgot to actually edit this page. It's June now so three months outdated, and I broke my phone so some of the pictures got lost. I guess I will have to do with some Instagram pictures I posted ***

The trip to Machu Picchu began at Ollantaytambo. It's a small town with Incan ruins of its own, but is probably often overlooked by the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu tourists. We took the train to Aguas Calientes to begin our Machu Picchu journey.

My first thought when I saw Machu Picchu after taking the bus up to the entrance was that it was a lot smaller than I imagined. It was definitely more exciting than Chichen Itza and Taj Mahal, but not as impressive as the Great Wall of China or the Colosseum.

After taking the mandatory tourist pictures with the ruins in the background, our guide took us around each of the temples and special areas to explain the history and the meanings. I generally didn't care about the history and wanted to soak in the view. My brother was too busy playing with the llamas.

The hill you see in the background of so many Machu Picchu pictures is called Huayna Picchu. It requires a different ticket (usually must be bought three months in advance) to climb due to safety reasons. I didn't know about it so didn't get to actually climb the steep hill and venture into the ruins on the top.


It began raining at night, so everyone convened at the hotel to enjoy a fancy dinner.Â I don't quite remember what I had for dinner, but I recount the conversation I had with a family from the Midwest. It's only memorable now that I'm in Milwaukee, thinking how boring the Midwest is. No wonder the family had to take vacations and travel around the world to break away from the dullness of daily routine.

The next morning, my brother and I woke up around 4:30 AM to watch the sunrise at Machu Picchu. You can buy a separate ticket to climb the mountain on the opposite side of Huayna Picchu. Despite the early thunderstorms, by the time we reached the entrance to the hike, the clouds cleared up. But we had mistimed the climb and ended up not reaching the top before the sunrise. Still, the view was breathtaking. I sat there for hours, listening to music, musing at the sight of tourists bustling around the Incan ruins, and writing down some thoughts before heading down to catch the train ride back.

There was a delicious lunch place next to our hotel. I had pineapple chicken for lunch with some soup and salad. I had a picture of it, but I didn't post it on Instagram so it's all just memories now. I miss the Indian siblings we had lunch with. The brother was a recent med-school graduate doing his residency in New York, and the sister was a nurse in Rhode Island. It was encouraging to see such busy people take the time to travel.

The best part of the trip was the train ride back. I sat next to a girl doing Peace Corp in the deserts of Peru, visiting her parents for the Machu Picchu trip. After graduation, she initially pursued her dreams in the advertising industry, before realizing that it wasn't the right option for her. I admired her courage to quit and dedicate two years of her time to Peace Corp. It was refreshing to hear stories from American people resisting the social pressures of the regimented path to success. Peace Corp is now in my potential post-graduation plans.
