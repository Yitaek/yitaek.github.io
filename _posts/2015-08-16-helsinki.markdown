_**Day 1**_



As it was the case traveling from Moscow to St. Petersburg, I elected to take the high-speed train to get to Helsinki. The train station (Finlandyskiy Station) is right off the red line on the Ploschad Lenina station. I feel like in Russia, if you know what Lenin looks like in Russian letters, you can find most places.



The international entrance is on the side-entrance though, so if you get lost, just say Allegro and they will tell you where to go. I’ve become so adjusted to speaking English and sign language in foreign countries, I can get by in most situations. I’m not sure if this is a good thing or not as I’m not making the effort to learn to local language.



First thoughts after arriving: the city is clean but facilities are noticeably old. Most of the signs are in English, and almost everyone can speak a little bit. At least the place I'm staying seems empty, in contrast to the busy nightlife of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

_**Day 2**_

Coming from St. Petersburg, Helsinki is such a boring city in comparison. But thankfully during my time here, Helsinki Festival was underway to alleviate some of my boredom. Actually, now that I look back I came to Helsinki at the perfect time. The walking tours are free only on weekends (I came on Sunday), and today was actually international food festival.

(Side note: Don’t buy breakfast at the hostel/hotels, there are cafes everywhere in Helsinki, and you can probably get fresh, cheap food at the markets as well.)

After procrastinating all morning, snoozing every 15 minutes, convincing myself there was nothing to see in Helsinki anyways, I finally headed downtown around 11am. The free walking tour started at Helsinki Cathedral. The city is so flat and small, if you just look up and look for a tall building, you should be able to easily identify a big white cathedral.

Finnish history is heavily influenced by those of Sweden and Russia as it was a subordinate country to each of the two nations. After Russia defeated the Swedes, it was granted a large degree of autonomy by the Russian tsars. Finnish took advantage of this, and while Russia was busy with its communist revolution, declared independence. Since Lenin spent significant time during his exile in Finland, Russia became one of the first countries to acknowledge Finland’s independence.

Helsinki was modeled after St. Petersburg, so you can clearly see all the similar architectural style, just in smaller scale. Looking around Senate square, you can also notice Alexander the Second statue. The Russia tsar used Finland like practice ground for democracy, evening granting Finland its own currency. However, after he was assassinated Russians took a harsher stance on Finland.

Finland, however, built upon its autonomy, establishing a national bank (fourth oldest in the world) and becoming one of the first countries to grant women suffrage.

The tour only took about two hours with many breaks in between. The city itself is so small, if you happen to miss the free tour, you can download a handy-dandy map from tasteofsundays and follow the suggested tour. I will just comment on the things not marked on the online map.

Near Kauppatori market square is a light bluish building, which is the city hall building. This building is important, because there’s a free public bathroom…and we all know how much of a struggle it is when you don’t have coins and need to go in Europe. Also by the market square is a fountain of a naked lady surrounded by four seals. Apparently it is a tradition for students to put their graduation caps on the lady the night before the first of May.

When you pass the bus station (Kamppi), you can see a big wooden structure that looks like Noah’s Ark. That is Chapel of Silence, a modern structure designed to keep out noise. If you walk past the bus station/mall, on the right side is the Temppeliaukio Rock Church. The church is carved into granite, reminiscent of some churches in Turkey.

Lastly, I’m not sure where this is on the map, but if you just look for the tallest building in town, you can locate Torni Hotel. On the top floor is a rooftop bar where you can just go up to take pictures of the city. This place during the war was a hub for poor artists (who paid their fees with their artwork) as well as KGB and Western spies.

After walking around the entire city, I came back to the market square to try some international food. I was craving some pho, so I had some Vietnamese food and tried some Turkish kababs. I was still hungry so I ate reindeer meatballs with garlic mayonnaise, which by the way should be brought to the US unless we already have it… To top it off, I visited a local microbrewery to try  Finnish ale called Weizen.

As the sun began to set, I walked up the hill to Erottajan Rescue Station Tower for Daivd Espinosa’s Mi Gran Obra show. I bought the tickets not knowing what the show was about as part of the Helsinki Festival (it just fit the time window that I wanted), but I was pleasantly surprised by it. He challenged existing trends in theater by moving the stage to a smaller set to deliver content. If you are curious, you can watch the show here:

Random Thought: There are a lot of smokers in Helsinki. I wonder if it’s because tobacco companies are taxed less.

_**Day 3**_

I’m glad I’ve only decided to stay two days in Helsinki. I ran out of things to do. Today just consisted of a halfway trip to Suomenlinna, a UNESCO heritage site. This sea fortress was used both by the Swedes and the Russians to protect Stockholm and St. Petersburg respectively.

The island is accessible from the market square via ferry. I would take the state-run ferry (5 euros) than the JT-line boat (8 euros). Speaking of tickets, I still don’t understand how the whole system works. It seems to be operating under a honor system. No one checks your tickets, and tourists seem to just get on the boat/train/metro/bus without paying.

The sea fortress is connected by several islands and has some leftover cannons by the beaches. It’s a small, quaint place that I recommended visiting if you have an extra day in Helsinki. The craft beers on the island wasn’t anything special, but who can complain about eating, drinking, and reading by seagulls on a nice little island?

I am currently on the Silja Serenade ferry to Stockholm. I intentionally bought bottom floor shared rooms to meet people, but I guess no one wants to travel with me today. It’ll be another day eating food (and drinking beer) by myself…yay.
