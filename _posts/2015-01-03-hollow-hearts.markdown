_I was born to make mistakes my apologies.
__Too busy chasing dreams to ever fall asleep.
__Conquer struggle, it was that or let it conquer me.
__Not afraid to burn on a stake for my beliefs.
__Here we go, a loaded chamber and a hollow heart.
__Another episode, predictable, a common thought.
__Beg for God to show the way but try to follow stars.
__Try so hard to hold it down, somehow it falls apart._




_- Senpai x Vessel “Hollow Hearts”_


Someone once told me I tend to blame myself for things beyond my control. I never understood what that meant, because I didn’t consider myself a complete control freak at all.

I just thought it was another way that I was different.

I always had a hard time relating to others—building common ground—because I thought so differently. This manifested itself most clearly when people would come to me for comfort. I have a habit of over simplifying everything that when I attempt to console others, it comes off as me dismissing or grossly minimizing the gravity of the issue.

Over time, I began to realize that my approach clearly didn’t work for anyone else. As I saw more and more people slip away, I became extremely cautious and resorted to the role of a listener, rather than attempting to offer words of consolation. Eventually, I would watch people spin out of control, and I would put the blame for their pain and struggles onto myself, permeating a sense of failure. I became disconnected as I avoided deeper relationships altogether.

This year, I’ve got a sense that I’ve been wrong all along.

It seems like true empathy does not exist—simply because it is unattainable.

In my times of trouble, I’ve learned that one suffers alone.

But happiness can be shared, even if it is temporary.

Looking back, all the times I tried to empathize or express sympathy, I was assuming control for others. I thought I could help out in some way if only I was able to find ways to relate and understand. Every time, however, I was limited to the role of an observer or listener.

Running around, playing soccer, and celebrating the sheer joy of kicking the ball around with kids in the slums yesterday, it hit me that maybe sharing happiness, not trying to understand, was the answer all along. The kids—and if I may generalize others—simply wanted to cherish life and share a moment of bliss.

Empathy may never be actualized, but shared happiness can replace the pain and the suffering that I tried to understand all along. Perhaps, I tried to rationalize emotions logically, instead of supplanting with other emotions.

When a person cries, the body releases hormones to counteract that response. It doesn’t try to figure out why the person is sad. It simply acts to revert that sadness into happiness.

In 2015, I want to fill my hollow heart with happiness.
