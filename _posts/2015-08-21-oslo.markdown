_**Day 1**_

Oslo/Norway is the worst Scandinavian country! Oslo is a small, boring city, granted spending one day doesn't do the city justice. But even compared to Helsinki, Oslo seems empty and boring. It isn't very tourist friendly, doesn't even use the Euro, and is expensive for no reason. Also, everything closes around 6pm, so if you get there later than that...all you can do is walk around, take pictures of empty streets, and eat dinner.

Well...I did exactly that...so I'll just include more pictures to make it look like I did more stuff. At least the view from the opera house & the food there was nice...

I highly recommend Oslo Hostel Central though. It's probably the best hostel I've stayed in so far (they've all been progressively better as I made my way west). There's free breakfast, laundry service, and nice beds.




Speaking of laundry, I finally got to wash all the sweaty clothes that's been rotting away in my backpack for weeks. I blame in tiredness, but being my clumsy self, I actually put my clothes in the dryer before washing them... I don't understand how I survived all these years.




On the bright side, I met some interesting people. I met yet another Australian guy who took interest in ViFlex and the conference I was going to. He recommended places to visit in Milan, and told me how it was free to see the Last Supper painting 20 years ago, but now you have to make reservations. My roommate is a middle-aged man from the Philippines. He is a self-described "starving artist," but in my mind if you are in Oslo, you can't be starving. Also, he was actually addicted to Instagram/Snapseed. He kept telling me to download Snapseed to edit my pictures. What's up with these travelers trying to convince me to download apps? Are they being paid?




Anyways, he gave me dried mangoes so I was happy.




_**Day 2**_


Don't do the free walking tours in Oslo! I know the tours are heavily dependent on the guides, but I could barely understand/hear what she was saying, and it would be better to explore the city on your own with a map. I felt like I was just checking off places on the map, instead of exploring the city.

The only note that I took during the tour was: "Falling gas prices. Norway Pension Fund used to ensure high living standards for generations to come: only invest 4% each year."

Other than that, I was happy to see the German couple from Stockholm again. They were complaining that you can't buy beer before 9am or after 8pm. I also spotted a guy who looked like Drake, and reminded me of the time that I saw fat Drake in Chicago this summer.

As you can tell, I didn't have that much fun in Oslo. I did go to the Viking Ship Museum and Polar Ship Museum. Here are more pictures:

I'm finally heading off to Copenhagen to meet up with old friends from Tanzania. Rejoice for human interaction!

(Side note: Americans are really loud. This girl at the airport talking on speaker phone and generally being annoying...or maybe I'm just getting grumpy.)
