Three days should be enough to see all of the city's touristy spots. Almost everything revolves around West Lake.

**West Lake**

West Lake reminded me of the Kirkland waterfront. The lake itself isn't particularly clean and sometimes the fog/smog covers the view, but overall was a pleasant sight. I recommend renting a bike and going around the entire lake. Bikes aren't allowed on the walkways right next to the lake, but there are plenty of sights to see along the bike roads. I never got to take a boat ride or go to the islands at the middle of the lake, but assume it would be worth the time.

**Leifeng Tower**

It costs 40 RMB to enter, but it's worth the money. I was initially excited because a friend told us there was a legend about a monkey or a white princess that is storied with the pagoda. It turns out the storyÂ is a love story about a man and a white snake who took on human form. Anyways, you can take the elevator up to the top floor, where you have the best view of West Lake, overlooking all the boats and bridges.

**Lingyin Temple**

By far my favorite place in Hangzhou. It was pouring rain when I visited, but in a way it made the underground caves/temples more impressive. I'm not sure what the story is behind the place, but there are tons of carved buddha sculptures in the caves. The most prominent one Fei Lai Feng is fenced off, but you can walk around towards the top by crossing one of the trees and come down the back way to see it.

**Xixi Wetland Park**

I'm not sure what makes this place a wetland park. It's literally a wetland...with water and no animal life. Everything is under construction still. I guess you can take a boat ride, but you can walk around and find more of the same thing everywhere. It's not worth the money to go there unless you've never seen a wetland before.

**Jiuxi 18 Stream**

We were led to this place by a local grandma who vowed to take us to a place with tea and waterfalls. To enter the nature walk area by the stream, you must pass through a huge tea town. I'm not sure what the tea was called but it had a light, clean taste. The walk to the various temples and the towers are surrounded by tea plantations. The maps were bit confusing so it took us a while to find the waterfall (I think it was called nine river creek or something).

**Hefang Street**

It's by Zhongshan Road and there is plenty of street food if you go at night. I wasn't brave enough to try stinky tofu, but there were lots of people buying all sorts of Chinese food. It's fun to walk around, checking out all the little shops, and watching old Chinese people exercising/dancing together in the parks.
