As the plane slowly descended onto the runway, with Burj Khalifa welcoming me to Dubai, I was nudged awake by the flight attendant asking me to fold the trays and return the seat to an upright position. All the screens on the plane started playing a welcome message to Dubai, showing off all the fancy building and the marvels of the city in the middle of the desert--but all I could think about at that moment was Russell Peters mocking the empty floors in all of those tall buildings.

After I deplaned, I went through my normal routine of looking for WiFi connection to tell my parents that I'm alive and to look for my connecting flight information. My parents asked me what it was like to visit Dubai again since my first time coming back from Turkey nearly 10 years ago. Back then I was a little boy, tired from a long mission trip in Turkey, fascinated by all Dubai - and the new 777 Emirates planes - had to offer. Now, Dubai was just another connecting airport to my final destination.

2015 was another year packed with travels. I celebrated New Years in Jaipur, India, surrounded by hundreds of Indian men trying to dance with one of our female friends at my homestay, and now I am embarking on my journey to Nepal, most likely going to work at a hospital on New Years since Nepali calendar works differently than ours. In between, I traveled to Peru, China, Russia, Scandinavia, Italy, and Nicaragua. It was only fitting to end the year and be late to school yet again at a different country.

If you have been following my blogposts, you probably noticed that my attitude towards traveling changed throughout the year. It used to be my getaway from reality, as I was completely struck with travel lust. Then at a certain point, it felt like I was traveling because I had time -- it seemed like the right thing to do.

Most recently in Nicaragua over Thanksgiving break, I was surprised to find myself wanting to go back home before the trip was over. Maybe it was because I got sick from eating street food. Maybe it was because there wasn't much to do when volcanos I intended to hike erupted. Or loneliness and fatigue that comes with traveling alone and having to make friends to eat with at new hostels every time.

Or maybe I simply missed home.

Although I'm spending a big chunk of my winter break in Nepal, I was home for the longest stretch of time since summer of 2014. It was nice to spend Christmas with the family and to lay around reading books, binge watching shows on Netflix, and getting fat from my mom's food.

I used to feed off the energy of backpackers on gap years, explorers who sought to travel the world, and people thinking that I was _cool_ for going on all these exotic trips. These things haven't gone away, but it was time for me see myself differently.

I recently read the book, "Defining Decade" by Megan Jay. In the "Work" section of the book, Dr. Jay wrote about how twentysomethings want to just be different. That was exactly what I wanted. I'm not caught in the hipster phase, but I simply wanted to different--and _interesting_.

This mindset establishes identity by defining ourselves by what we aren't, rather than with affirmative characteristics (i.e. what we are). It's easy to construct our persona this way, and we naturally want to be different to find our individuality. But this can only get us so far: at a certain point, we need to show "who we are" rather than "who we are not."

After I came back from Tanzania, I had this burning desire to be different. Shocked by the European mindset on life that stood in stark contrast with the checklist-style life I was used to (study, get into good college, get a good internship, graduate with a fancy job, get married, etc), I didn't want to be a typical Dukie--or a "typical" Korean-American (whatever this means).

I don't want to use this as an excuse, but I was also coming off of a toxic relationship after the trip. Caught up in rage or sadness, I just wanted to be the antithesis of what Duke and old friends had been shoving down my throat. Besides I felt like my life before college was pretty different than the rest of the Duke students, and I was doing just fine.

I didn't want to "waste" my engineering education to make powerpoints and excel sheets going into consulting when I didn't really know what consulting even entailed. I didn't want to "sell my soul" to become an investment banker, trader, or work at Wall Street. I didn't want to be caught up in the social hierarchy, GPA, fancy jobs, or whatever else that seemed to obsess those around me at the time.

To me, the easiest way to be _different_ was to use my time to travel.

It's only fitting that I'm going to Nepal on another Engineering World Health trip since my EWH trip to Tanzania two summers ago.




So much has changed since that trip, thanks to my perhaps flawed desire to be different. I'm not trying to say my attitude was wrong or that I regret traveling to all these places just to be cool, hipster, or however you might call it. It was helpful for me to start by defining myself for who I am not. From my encounters with so many retired businessmen and those trying to pivot career paths, I realized that consulting may not be for me. Through ViFlex meetings and CGIU presentations, I began to appreciate the work of bankers and consultants, while simultaneously learning that financial work is not my forte. Lastly, from several mentors I found through the Duke network and VFA, I saw that joining a NGO or doing humanitarian work on the field isn't the only way, and sometimes not the most efficient way, to make an impact.




All this is to say that as graduation draws near, my "soul-searching" trip is also coming to an end. I can't just hop on a plane and travel to a different country to think things over or see things through.




It's time for me to move forward.
