_Day 1 - Foreigner Experience_

I need to stop buying 6 am flights, at least until I get my Global Entry application approved. Waking up at 4 am is brutal even if RDU is a relatively small airport. I was actually surprised to find a line that early in the morning.

I'm not sure why I was bit nervous to go on this trip. I've gone on solo trips before, I know enough Spanish to get by, and my brother will be joining me in couple days anyways, but as I was finishing up work and downloading files to work on in case I had no Internet during the trip, I had this irrational nervousness creeping in.

Also, note to self, I need to stop booking American Airline tickets no matter how cheap they are. I've never had one AA flight that wasn't delayed. On my second flight from Miami to Managua, I was happy for 10 minutes because the flight was about to leave on time and no one was sitting next to me. Then the flight attendant moved me to the exit row and the flight was delayed for another 50 minutes.

_Day 2 -_ _Volcano Boarding & White Folks_

Being fluent in English is such a privilege. When you put together a guy from Iceland, Germany, Netherlands, and Brazil, they all talk in broken English and somehow the conversation flows. I guess the problem with being a fluent English speaker who _looks_ Asian is that all these travelers assume that you don't speak English and don't make the effort to strike up a conversation.

I'm not the most socially outgoing person, and I always find myself making a dumb comment about the weather or something about the country to make new friends.

My line of the day was, "so you guys trying to beat the fastest record volcano boarding down?"

Even that was after spending an hour in the crammed truck to get to Cerro Negro. I enjoy listening to all these people talk and pretending like I can't understand though. I'm not sure if that's weird or not.

Anyways, Cerro Negro was my first experience to volcano boarding (or more aptly volcano sledding). I think the idea of volcano sledding is awesome, but in reality, the dust and rocks flying everywhere hurt, and it is a dangerous sport (?).

When you arrive at the bottom of the volcano, the youngest one in Nicaragua and one that erupts every 10-15 years (last eruption in 1999), the guides remind people to go slow and not get hurt. But when you get up the volcano, you begin to question, who was this dumb guy who thought "oh going down a volcano would be fun on a piece of wood."

The hike up is about 45 minutes, mild difficulty (even with the boards), and beautiful. There's something strangely calming about seeing vegetation grow back into the hardened lava. You can marble at stark contrast between the sea of blackness from active volcano and lush vegetation. Maybe it's a constant reminder of life and death and their cyclic relationship.

I went on the volcano with Quetzaltrekkers, and I highly recommend them because they let you go down twice. I would actually volcano board down on the first try and run down on the second time around though.

Also, try to pick a good bag because you might get screwed like me and not get gloves or suits with strings to tighten it around.
