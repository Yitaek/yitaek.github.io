"Oh yeah, how was India?"

Since stepping foot onto Duke's campus -- and the few times I've managed to escape the wilderness of Edens -- that was the universal greeting that I received. People told me that they've been following my blog and telling me about the time that they went to India or nearby places.

At first it surprised me that people actually read my blog. I initially starting writing to let the donors know how exactly their donations were being spent. If I may be cynical/realistic for a moment, I'm sure that people didn't really read my blog but said these things as part of "small talk" just like how I say "let's get a meal sometime" when I don't really mean it at all (I apologize to all those who I've said this to).

But what struck me was my response. More often or not, I ended up saying that it was good...and end there. I would either walk off to class, plugging in my earphones to listen to music or avoid talking to people, or simply ask how their winter break was. It may very well be the case that I lack the social or communication skills to keep up a good conversation; I'm an awkward, reserved person after all. But digging deeper, I noticed that I unconsciously began shutting myself from the world.

I've never actually got to share things that I never wrote on my blog: my true feelings about India, real reasons for going away from home in the first place, and the doubts I had while on the trip. Hiding behind that effortless-perfection-Dukie facade, I resorted to the usual excuses of being too busy and needing time for myself to avoid further interaction.

I don't think I've ever had one best friend. From some time, I began compartmentalizing my friend groups: school/homework buddies, church friends, people I play basketball with, the poor souls who listen to me vent, and so on.

It's not the case where I want to be completely different people in each group, reinventing my identity wherever I go. It could be seen as me trying to get attention or acceptance in wider circles, but in reality, it's just my simple fear of relationships.

I'm afraid to open up and let people into my life, because I've come to perceive myself as bad luck on others. I've tricked myself into thinking that all the bad things around me to the people I once cared for have stemmed from me. It's an egocentric thought really, but I think the absurd prevalence of such events in my life is too abnormal to call it coincidence.

Regardless of the reason, I've been internally shutting myself out or refusing to let others into my life.

Last week, I had this crazy idea about how our lives would be radically different and perhaps significantly better if our average lifespan was reduced to 30 years. Those who unfortunately had to listen to me babble about such a grim thought heard me say things like how we become complacent and live a boring life, because we take each day for granted on an unfounded belief that there will be a tomorrow. If we actually had only 30 years to live, maybe, just maybe, we would do things we actually enjoy doing everyday.

Everyone around me thought I was crazy or depressed, but I think it's just a manifestation of my internal state right now: I've grown so bored with life, because I stopped investing myself in it. I forced myself out and removed myself to become an observer.

I don't know when was the last time I had a true conversation without the help of that glass of Merlot. As part of finding my Fatima and reclaiming my happy self, I want to open up again and step inside my life...and into the lives of others. I guess that means actually replying back to people's messages, checking up on people from time to time, and climbing out of my hiding spot that I built under my bed with my fridge and bean bag chair when people are around.

So here's to me reverting back to younger, naive version of Yitaek. The small Asian kid who thought listening to KnowMads made him hipster and so cool, when he didn't even know what "go and grab your friend mollie and let's go for a ride" meant. Here's to the kid sitting on the sidewalk, waiting to picked up from basketball practice, trying to understand what Pepe meant in Saturdayzed:

_I was sitting on the sidewalk on a Thursday night, watching the cars go by. And it made me think, why do we move so fast when there's so little time? _
