Before I left for India, I told my parents that I might not want to do engineering for a living. I wanted to travel the world and build hospitals in the most remote regions. To my surprise, my mom told me I could also travel during my time off from work. Since my parents have been so supportive of everything that I had wanted or dreamed of, this slight remark came off as a huge surprise--a reality check.

Later she told me that she's been praying that she can let go of her ambitions for me and support my decision, whatever it may be. She explained that she, just like any other mother would, wanted to see her son be successful. Whether it was boasting to her friends about my job/salary or my academic success, she secretly wanted me to get recognition, even if she would never show it.

Still, my parents let me spend Christmas and New Years away from home, leaving little time to spend with family to allow me to chase my dreams. I couldn't be more thankful to have such amazing parents.

If Tanzania was a rude awakening to the real world, this trip was somewhat of a catharsis for me.

I first want to thank my host family and the three other medical volunteers who spent these last two weeks with me. Ugrassen, my best friend, woke me up every day with chai and loudly greeting with the daily, "Yitaek have you eaten?" Proclaiming that language barrier is our common enemy, he attempted to tell jokes and accepted me as his son and best friend. Auntie Sunita always cooked for us and arranged everything from rides to throwing a blanket on top of us when we would fall asleep. Dron did an amazing job organizing the first ever Rajasthan festival. Daksha was a lifesaver, translating everything for me and keeping me entertained with stories about Indian culture and her love for bollywood films.

Ah, what more can I say about the volunteers. They turned a disillusioned boy who saw them as ones who were only here to build their resume (which is partially true) to ones placed here for a greater purpose. They brought out the best in me, regardless of what they think (jokes), and turned me into a thankful person who can appreciate that at least such systems exists to send volunteers. The KFC and Baskin Robbins runs, chicken and t-rex dances, and randomly blurting chip-chip and freebie helped me crack my shyness and instilled in me true happiness that I haven't felt for over an year.

More importantly, it reconfirmed what I want to do--just also showed me different ways to get there. I could be like Belgium John and recharge myself from time to time, while working to design medical devices that can impact more people at once. Or I can be like Dr. D. R. Mehta and live a life filled with compassion and run my version of Jaipurfoot. Or I can reconsider the med school route and return as a doctor.

In any case, the trip restored the curious, emphatic teenager Yitaek back into my life. The smile on the kids' faces at JKSMS and Shrestha, the positive feedback I received for ViFlex, and the inspiring body of work done at Jaipurfoot all reverted me back to naive Yitaek, carefree and full of hope. But this time, it isn't unfounded hope or ignorance of harsh reality. It is belief that even the tiniest flick of light is enough to guide someone out of darkness.

Overall, this trip left something more to be desired. I want to travel every time I have a chance. It's not travel lust, but dream chasing after my newfound Fatima. If I may be selfish, I want a travel buddy next time and be proficient in the local language to absorb more.

However cheesy it may sound, from the bottom of my heart, I sincerely thank all those who supported me financially, with prayer, and with encouraging words over Facebook and Whatsapp throughout my trip.

And to my beloved parents, thank you so much for guiding me through this world. I won't disappoint your unconditional support. I may not be the son who gets the type of recognition you once desired, but I long to be your proud son and God's proud child.
