On April 1, 2016, I had a privilege of representing ViFlex at Clinton Global Initiative University 2016 conference held at UC Berkeley. At the Opening Plenary session, The Courage to Create, President Bill Clinton acknowledge the work that ViFlex has been doing across the world. If you are curious, you can watch the video below as I explain what ViFlex is all about.
