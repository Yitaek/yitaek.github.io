Last Friday, we finally left TCDC to our hospitals. This meant no more Swahili lessons, Larry's engineering lectures, wifi, homestay food, and laundry machines. Huruma Hospital, located in Rombo, is about an hour out from Moshi when riding a noah (faster version of the dala-dala). When we arrived at the hospital, however, there was a send-off party for a retiring doctor so all the staff was gone. To make things worse, the contact sheet given to us was completely wrong. The housekeeper we were to call had quit working long time ago, and the phone number for the head doctor was out of service. We managed to find another head doctor in his office, but he told us that he had no idea that we were coming. Thankfully, we met the new housekeeper Scola who let us into our hostel. The hostel--other than having no toilet seat, shower, wifi ( I'm stealing wifi from our Dutch roommate at the hospital), oven, laundry machine, non-sketchy blankets, and functional windows--is not too bad. The canteen nearby has like three things on the menu, so we are forced to make meals ourselves...with no meat. I guess I'll go vegetarian for a month.

On the weekend, we booked a last-minute trip to Lake Chala, through the safari company that our Dutch roommate recommended to us. When we got to the lake, the police tried to enforce a new $10 fee for all the visitors. Thankfully, our guides convinced the police that we were all under 18 years old. I'm not sure how the police thought John and Ari were minors though.

The lake, bordering the Kenyan border, reminded me of all the lakes in Washington. After lunch, a group of us got to swim and kayak at the lake. It was so relaxing to paddle to the middle of the lake and lay in the sun. Meanwhile, Jason and Louise took the canoe to the Kenyan side and came back. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">I hope that is breaking Duke Engage/EWH rules so Jason gets sent home and I can take the room for myself.</span>Â As the sun went down, we hopped back on the safari bus to head back to Moshi. The tour guide was kind enough to help us find a hostel to stay. We ended up staying at Paradise Hostel. Although breakfast wasn't provided, the facilities were decent for a cheap price. There's also a Indo-Italian restaurant right next to it so I would recommend staying there if Kilimanjaro Backpackers is full.

On Monday, the technician working at the hospital gave us a tour. Huruma Hospital is fairly large, equipped with several x-rays that Phillips technicians maintain. While we knocked on all the doors to complete the inventory and meet with the doctors, the technicians at the hospital were fixing an old autoclave. The autoclaves did not have maker, model name, or serial number. The gasket was broken and finding replacement parts was practically impossible. The technicians were jerry-rigging something to fix it. Everything at the hospital is going by so slowly. Although we found some medical devices to repair, the workdays are so short (8 AM to 3:30 PM with a loooong lunch break) and the two existing technicians seem to have most things under control.

Today was bit different. In the morning, we fixed a surgical lamp that had been broken for a long time. The doctor and our Dutch roommate described how the light would not turn on sometimes and automatically turn off after a while. They even told us a story of when they had to perform a circumcision under this flickering light. There was a problem with a switch, which we could not fix since it was an internal mechanical issue. We ended up taking the switch out and shorting the connection together so the doctors could turn it on and off by plugging in the machine. In the meantime, Jason also fixed the surgical bed latch so the doctors could easily raise and lower the bed.

After we finished repairing the surgical light, we were taken to a room to fix a clock. This was a relatively simple fix. We placed a new battery and taped the loose parts so the clock hands would not scratch against it. This clock was placed in the cervical cancer testing room, so the nurse was really thankful that they could now properly measure time. The same nurse gave us a scale to fix. While Sofie worked on recalibrating the scale by tightening the loose parts inside and readjusting the springs, I tried to troubleshoot the fetal doppler given to me by the head doctor. I still haven't figured out what is exactly wrong with it. I suspect that it is a wire-issue, but we will have to wait until tomorrow to confirm. Since the fetal doppler took so long to repair, right before lunch, I took some time off to replace the broken diaphragm on a stethoscope.

Hopefully, we will keep up this pace throughout the time that we are working here. Also, if anyone has suggestions on how to fix the fetal doppler and where we can get pulse oximeters for the hospital, please let me know!
