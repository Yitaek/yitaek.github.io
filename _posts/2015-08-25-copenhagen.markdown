_**Day 1**_

I'm so gullible...or maybe I'm just a paranoid traveler. Before I boarded the plane to Copenhagen, my friends in Denmark told me that they were too busy working so gave me vague directions to the metro station. I was bit nervous, because earlier in the year when I went to China, I couldn't find my friend initially and had no address or phone number or anything. I was just hoping that stores nearby the metro stations had some wifi so I could Whatsapp them.

After collecting my bags and frantically connecting to airport wifi to look at Google maps and download offline maps, I was just searching for the metro sign when another friend called out my name. I haven't even talked to her since I let the Danish crew that I was visiting them, so I initially thought she was coincidentally just at the airport. The poops that pulled a prank on me to go to the metro station ended up being late so they sent the other friend to pick me up while they ran to the airport from the metro station... I'm just blessed with the best friends in the world.

Still, I was glad that they picked me up. I should not fly into cities after dark, because everything is closed. I definitely would not have figured out how to ride the metro with so many check in and check out posts, let alone the bus.

Like the good old times in Tanzania, we headed straight to the bars for a quick drink. The public transportation isn't as friendly as it was in Stockholm, and everything isn't as close as it was in Helsinki/Oslo, so I had to walk around busy "party-streets" with my backpack. I'm not sure if my friends kept on trolling me or not, but we could not find a suitable bar (too loud, too crowded, or closed), and ended up roaming around the city center for a while. On the bright side, I became familiar with the local hotspots (Drunken Flamingo).

Maybe it was because I landed on Friday night and that I felt safer with friends going out, but Copenhagen felt more vibrant at night. It was comparable to St. Petersburg. The only difference was that Copenhagen was more Americanized. The main street had Hard Rock Cafe, surrounded by McDonalds, Burger King, and 7-11 (speaking of which, why are there so many 7-11's in Copenhagen?).

When we finally found a bar, it was already past 1am. We intended to stay for one quick beer, but random friends kept showing up to say hi and to catch up with one of them who studied abroad in California this year. Many of them were also attending EMBC Milano, so I luckily made some more Danish friends for the duration of the conference.

_**Day 2**_

There are three ways to get around in Copenhagen:




  1. Walk


  2. Illegally ride public transportation ("accidentally" forget to check in/out for metro, use screenshot version of the bus card, etc)


  3. Rent a bike


I suggest the third option. The city is only friendly to bikers. The bus system is fairly intricate, but the times are not very convenient, and the metro only has two lines, only useful to go to the airport. I figured this out the hard way. The friend that I was staying with in Copenhagen lived bit far away from the city center, and had to ditch me for soccer match in the morning.

After wandering around the park next to the national stadium, I went to Relae for lunch (No. 45 restaurant in 2015). Relae offers a four or seven course meal for lunch with extra cheese serving. The main focus is on using fresh vegetables. I thought there was a hint of citrus in all of their dishes. The meal began with sourdough bread (I guess Michelin star restaurants only serve sourdough?), mackerel with puree, roasted carrots with seaweed and berries, poached chicken and peas, and blue cheese with springs, topped off by fermented ice cream with caramelized grape seeds and warm raspberry. It's perhaps not fair to compare dinner with lunch, but I personally liked the dishes at Frantzen better than Relae. This makes me wonder what White Rabbit (No. 23 in Moscow, could not go due to delayed plane), Noma (No. 3 in Copenhagen, could not get a reservation in time), and Maeemo (No. 64 in Oslo, not enough time) would have been like. Looking at the list, I noticed that I had so many chances to go to all the ones in Peru and Chicago, but I didn't know about in time. I guess I will have to take a food-trip later. On the bright side, the meal at Relae is reasonably priced (well, relatively). Danish people warned me how expensive things were in Copenhagen, but I feel like everything is cheaper here than all the other Scandinavian countries I've been to so far. For your reference, from most expensive to least: Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen.

One nice thing about Copenhagen is the prevalence of free wifi. Unlike most countries, you don't have to send an sms to your phone to get a code for free wifi. Also, if you are desperate, I noticed that most wifi passwords are same as the wifi name or restaurant name, so try that!

After walking for another half an hour, I reached Tivoli Gardens (second oldest amusement park in the world). According to Wikipedia (you see, I didn't go on legit walking tours in Copenhagen so all my "facts" will be from the internet as my local friends knew nothing about their city), it's the second most popular seasonal theme park in the world, but I don't understand why. The park is tiny, and the rides are so expensive. I may be spoiled with the Disneylands and Six Flags in America, but Tivoli was nothing impressive. While waiting for more friends from Aalborg to join us, I went on the drop tower to get a panoramic view of the city.

Ironically, when the Aalborg people arrived, the Copenhagen people had to leave us for a bit, so the Danish people who didn't even live in Copenhagen had to give me a tour of the city. If you want to know about the history and such, I suggest you go on a walking tour or some other tour of some sort, as the locals have no clue what the buildings, let alone where they are. On a side note, I was bit sad that one of the Aalborg people could not make it due to family matters, but he told me that he still carries the note I wrote to him at the end of the Tanzania trip, so it made me happy.

The tour of the city ended abruptly when we reached Nyhavn. We stopped for a quick beer and to catch up (the Tanzania group/Danish people like their cheap beer), but it was soon time to find my way to Amass (No. 64) for another gourmet meal. It was a thank-you meal for my Tanzania work partner/Danish mom, but she had real troubles with finding her way around in Copenhagen. She refused to use Google maps (umm who doesn't use Google maps these days?), and we ended up relying on my offline map to get to the restaurant only 45 minutes late.

(Side note: it's hard to get to the other side of the canals; the water ferry runs every 30 - 45 minutes. Also, make sure that it's going in the right direction or you will take an hour detour.)

Amass was similar to Relae, but with more meat options. The restaurant was spacious and really modern looking. Since it was a fancy meal with someone else, I also ordered wine pairings, but it wasn't that good. Nothing like the accidental Dom Perignon I ordered at Frantzen. If anything, don't order the dessert wine, as it will destroy all your palate that you built up throughout the meal. The course was comprised of typical Scandinavian dishes: mackerel, onion salad, tomato & cherry mix in tomato water, pork belly, and potato ice cream. At least, they didn't serve some fancy sourdough bread, instead they served potato bread with spring vegetables.

The rest of the night was a typical Tanzania crew Danish night. Let's just say we came home when the sun was rising. Oh but I met a guy carrying around liquorish and trying to convince people that he looked like Ryan Gosling. I told him no, then he was saying some racist things at me. Maybe it's because I didn't understand anything other than him making the chinky eyes, but my friends got angrier at him than I was. Not sure where I'm going with this...maybe it was a case of "white guilt" or me tolerating everything.

On a side note, I didn't take any pictures today, so a random poster I found at the bus stop. The guy really wants to go to Nickleback concert, but his friends ditched him, so he's offering to pay for everything for anyone to go with him to the concert. Hit him up if you are interested:

_**Day 3**_

(I'm getting lazy with these blogposts... The conference in Milan is so near, and everyone else is starting school now.)

We woke up early in the morning to the sound of my friend coming home. She was laughing uncontrollably. When she finally stopped to go to bed, she was like, "The boat engine is broken, so no more boating. But we can sleep now! Sorry I was laughing so much because I'm still drunk." This is what happens when the country has no open-container laws and sets the drinking age at 14.

My friends by the way are terrible at being on time. We made plans to meet by the harbor to go on the canal tour at noon, and they started waking up around 11:30am and intentionally made plans to be late. My Danish mom went to the bakery though and bought me some Danish pastries like Danish (the bread) and Copenhagen bread. Also, below is bread with ham and cucumbers, which is apparently a popular breakfast dish in Denmark (this is debatable though because my Danish friends just troll me all the time).

After we finally got to the harbor around 1:30pm, we hopped on the canal tour for a quick look around town. I didn't really take notes during the tour, so I only have some crappy pictures from the boat. If you are interested in local hotspots (e.g. where drunk people have fight nights, places to get cheap beer), you can message me privately. Also, no matter how much people tell you the little mermaid is "little," you won't really understand until you see it.

Paprioen is just across the canal from Nyhavn (can access by taking the 991 or 992 ferry), and is a hub for Danish street food. My friends were too lazy to cross the canal, but I heard it's a good place to get cheap, good food if you don't want to spend millions at Noma or other fancy restaurants.

As the sun began to set, we headed over to Nemoland in Christiana for a Danish reggae concert. The Danish people really wanted me to do all the touristy things--I felt like I was their token Asian friend at times, holding up the peace sign in front of all the tourist attractions--so I rode the city bike to Christiana. The city bike is motorized and really heavy, I wouldn't recommend riding one to get around the city. It's 25 Danish Krone per hour, so it's better to just go to a bike shop and rent one for 8 euros (~60 krone) the whole day.

Christiana reminded me a lot of Capitol Hill near Seattle. It's a free-town built around a community of people who refused to pay taxes. If you are into rasta culture, listen to Bob Marley, have a hemp sticker (or smoke chalala - their slang for weed), Christiana might be the place to visit. You aren't allow to take pictures though, so I only have one picture from the concert. The lake area by Christiana is beautiful, so walk around it if you have a chance. Something I find strange in Copenhagen though is that on all these lakes, no one is kayaking or paddle boarding. Maybe it's because it's never sunny here.

Although I did not understand a single word of the concert (one of my friends kindly translated some of the lyrics), it was still a fun experience. The opener for the concert was a terrible rapper whom the crowd did not even bother to stand up or cheer when he desperately yelled, "Christiana make some noise!" But once Falfa (his name means granpa) came on, the whole town went crazy. Apparently the opening song was dedicated to a famous artist who grew up in Christiana and a lot of the songs were covers, so the entire place was bumping. During the concert though, you will notice all these people collecting beer and plastic bottles. The locals call them gypsies, who make a living out of returning bottles (the compensation is 1, 2, and 5 krone for different materials).

Everyone was super dead from last night so after the concert we just went to get kebabs before heading home. There is a strangely huge population of Turkish immigrants in Denmark, so every street is flooded with kebab stands. All the other stores close around 10pm, but the kebab stands are open all night along with good old Mackie D's and Burger King.

_**Day 4**_

The curse of terrible Danish summer bestowed upon us today. It started raining throughout the day, ruining our plans to "chill" at the beach and king's garden. I carried around my two backpack like an ultimate tourist, while climbing up one of the church/towers for one last look at the city. Apparently the king didn't want to take the stairs, so he made the entire tower a huge spiral ramp.

After eating brunch at a creepy place by the gardens, and drinking coffee a million times, I headed towards the airport. I can't believe I managed to hit six cities in about two weeks. I think the amount of days I spent at each city was adequate, but I wish I had the opportunity to visit Peterhof, do the one-day Norway train trip, and eat at Noma.

Perhaps I'll do another big Europe trip again, finishing off the Nordic countries (Iceland) and some of the Western Europe countries that only flew in and out of (Netherlands, Belgium) in the near future.
