Nane nane (8th of the 8th month) is a national holiday celebrating all the farmers in Tanzania. This meant a three-day weekend and a long trip to Tanga beach on Eastern Tanzania. Even without the public holiday though, this week felt extremely short. On Tuesday, we spent most of our time at St. Joseph's Hospital in Moshi, training the staff how to use the four incubators they had in the labor ward. Previously, they have been sending all the premature babies to KCMC, but hopefully after this training (and our awesome step-by-step guide), they can now administer all the premature babies at St. Joseph's. Afterwards, we spent rest of our time helping Jurom at Health Technology Science Center and split some time at KCMC and Mawenzi before heading back to Huruma.

Tanga is the third-largest town and the second-largest seaport in Tanzania. Just south of Tanga is Pangani, known for its beautiful beaches (perhaps not as great as Zanzibar) that reminded me of Cebu. To get to Pangani, however, we had to drive 8 hours crammed in a bus on unpaved roads. As soon as we arrived at our resort, we all headed to the beach and jumped in to swim and toss around the frisbee. With palms trees on my back and the Indian Ocean in front of me, I felt like I was on vacation in Tanzania. For a while, I debated leaving the life in the states behind and moving to Tanzania to work at a resort like this.
At night, low tides revealed more of the sandy beach that I had envisioned previously. Along with Arjun and Ari, we walked down the shores, looking for a pina colada. Although we did not find any huts with fruits and drinks, we did see a Maasai village with a myriad of fishing boats. It was strange to think that right next to this fancy resort was a village where people probably fished for sustenance.

As the sun began to set, conversations began to become more sentimental. The fact that we only had one more week left on this trip loomed on us largely. Starting from the people we were going to miss back home to shortcomings of the trip to finally expecting to mostly forget all the little things that happened in Tanzania in couple of months as we become adjusted to the college-routine again, the mellow mood encompassed us on our way back to our tent.

On Saturday, we woke up early to take the dhow and snorkel at nearby coral reefs. Perhaps, my stereotype of Africa had been dominated by savannas and jungles, but I never imagined snorkeling in Tanzania. After a sailing out for a while, we reached a barrier of corals where waves were crushing against it and made it look like we were on the shore in the middle of the ocean. Snorkeling itself, however, wasn't so pleasant. I learned that snorkeling without the snorkel is actually difficult and ending up having seawater dumped into my nose. Still, I saw plenty of starfish and tropical fish in the shallow waters.
For lunch, we took advantage of the low tides and visited a small sand island. Coral and shells that were swept onto the beach made quite a beautiful sight. I underestimated the strong sun rays in Africa though and ended up being sunburnt as I laid in the sun until high tides swept away the island.

Before dinner, we rode the bus to visit downtown Pangani. In contrast to the fancy resorts, the town resembled any other town in Tanzania: run down houses littered with pubs and street vendors. But the actual beach in Pangani was more sandy than the one near our resort. Pangani looks like beaches in California, whereas the beach by our resort is more like Cebu. When our search for pina coladas proved to be fruitless, we returned to our campsite to enjoy quality seafood. InÂ Tanzania, I've been eating vegetarian meals at the hospital, either chipsi mayai or wali nyama at canteens, or Indian food in town; so prawns, fish fillets, and crayfish were good for some variety.Nighttime at the beach consisted of a bonfire, beach music, and no Corona. Being pushed closer to the campsite by the incoming tide, we tried to keep the bonfire alive, while enjoying our last weekend together. When the moon was covered by the thick clouds, people began to swim in the ocean--some without clothes on. I may have been one of those people...and I can now say that I have skinny dipped in the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean.

*** I didn't take any picture on this trip so I'm stealing all of these from John and Pranali
