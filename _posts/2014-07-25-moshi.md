title: Moshi Weekend
category: travel
---

The past two days the hospital has been empty. Although I'm working at a Catholic Hospital, most of the doctors, nurses, and staff took days off to celebrate the end of Ramadan. One of our electricians left for Moshi, while the other who promised to find us some electrodes to test out the ECG we dug up from the storage room never returned.

It has already been almost two weeks at our hospital. So far, we fixed a fetal doppler, multitude of centrifuges, stethoscopes, scales, blood cuffs, and pulse oximeters. Yet, I still feel like we haven't done much. None of our work has been "sustainable." Other than perhaps creating a step-by-step guide to use the scanner for the receptionists to use, all we have done so far is just assisting the two talented technicians on the hospital with petty fixes.

On Tuesday though Daria took us to Himo Hospital to fix an ultrasound with Jurom (technician at Health Science Technology Center in Moshi) and to scout out the location for next year's EWH participants. Once we got there, the head director of the hospital showed us the operating theater that was under construction. A lot of the donated equipment haven't been sorted out and was missing the right power supply/transformer. The ultrasound we opened up was missing a CD for the setup; someone had tried to reboot the machine and it was having software issues. We also looked at a vital sign monitor, but it had missing transistors, and we could not find a manual online to look up the circuit schematics. Since our visit to the hospital was relatively short, Daria took us to St. Joseph's Hospital. where Jurom had fixed and installed four incubators. However, the hospital staff did not know how to use the incubators properly, and the premature babies were being sent to KCMC. The head doctor really wanted us to come train them on the following week. Hopefully this project will be a nice change of pace from just working in Huruma.

On the weekend, everyone convened at Moshi to visit the hot springs and Marangu falls. But first, Friday night was the opening night of Glaciers, a super wazungu bar, so most of the group headed over there on a random bus that we found at night. Contrary to what I've heard from previous participants and Daria, Glaciers wasn't as good as some of the other clubs we've been to. It was more like a huge bar/BBQ place with some cool places to relax. I did, however, meet an interesting man there who told me he was an immigration officer--I was pretty sure he was a drug dealer--who asked me to help him meet wazungu girls. In return, he gave me a Che Guevara necklace.

Except for the KCMC people who already visited the hot springs the week before (they also elected to go bird watching at Lake Chala), most of us headed to Maji Moto (hot water) on Saturday. The roads leading up to the hot springs was very crude. At some point, we had to get out of the car, move some rocks, and drive on mud/puddle mixture before getting back on.

Maji Moto should be renamed to the oasis. The little mangrove appeared in the middle of nowhere amongst the dusty town around it, and the water isn't even hot--or warm for that matter. Most of the time, we were standing on underwater branches to fight the current and watch others fail on the swings. Still, eating chipsi mayai for lunch and swimming in the water made for a picturesque weekend.

On Sunday, the people who actually lived in Marangu ditched us, so we randomly took a dala and was dropped off in the middle of the street. After walking for 30+ minutes, blindly following a local guy, we found the trailhead to a small waterfall. (Apparently, it wasn't the small waterfalls that Marangu people lately ended up going to.) The hike down was short, but relatively steep to do in slippers. There was a "swimming" spot, but the water was so cold that we ended up just taking pictures by the waterfall and calling it a day.
