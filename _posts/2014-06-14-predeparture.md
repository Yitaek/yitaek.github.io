Finally finished packing after procrastinating for days. I'm not sure if I packed too much or too little, but hopefully I didn't forget everything. Tomorrow I will be flying to Amsterdam, meet up with three other Duke students, and fly down to Kilimanjaro airport together. Arusha is 10 hours ahead of PST so I think if I sleep all the way on my flight to Amsterdam, I won't have a terrible jet lag on Sunday.

Now that I'm about to leave, I'm thinking of all the things I will miss while I'm gone: brother's graduation, NBA finals, world cup, hanging out with friends who have been in school all this time, and MamaÂ Hwang's food. So I've decided to look back at all the things I did during the summer so far and make a list of things I'm looking forward to in Tanzania.

Since coming home from DukeEngage Academy, I've done the following:
<ul>
    <li>Worked at a biophysics lab at UW</li>
    <li>Went to Childish Gambino and Logic concert</li>
    <li>Watched the Mariners lose...again</li>
    <li>Jumped off an airplane at 14000 ft</li>
    <li>Drove on the Oregon Coast on a sand buggy</li>
    <li>Read four books: The Alchemist, On the Road, Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Man's Search for Meaning</li>
    <li>Hiked a bunch: Rattlesnake, Ecola State Park, Cape Disappointment, Talapus &amp; Ollalie Lake, Barclay Lake, Mason Lake, Hobbit Trail</li>
    <li>Finished watching Homeland</li>
    <li>Attempted to learn some Swahili...and failed</li>
</ul>
<div>

Even though I was only home for five weeks, bored to death half the time, I think I've done more than wasting all my time. Hopefully, in Tanzania, I will more more productive. Before I leave Arusha, I'm looking forward to the following:

</div>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>Mastering conversational Swahili</li>
    <li>Fixing at least one medical equipment</li>
    <li>Training at least one technician</li>
    <li>Going to the Serengeti</li>
    <li>Climbing Mt. Meru</li>
    <li>Finding a project to "make a difference" at the local hospitals</li>
    <li>Get better at blogging</li>
</ul>
<div>

I'll do my best to update my blog at least once a week when I get internet access. If you are reading, please pray for the team's health and safety as well as the work that we will be doing there! Also, leave me some comments/questions so I'll have some motivation to keep writing.
