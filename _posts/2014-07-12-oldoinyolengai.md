<p class="separator">If you Google Ol Doinyo Lengai (Mountain of God), the current status of the volcano is list as erupting. The last major eruption was in 2007, and another one is said to be due soon...and I climbed it this past weekend.</p>

After being sick all week due to flu-like symptoms, I was barely feeling better when I got in the safari Jeep to head off to Lake Natron. The supposed three-hour drive turned out to be close to seven hours in this desert. When we stopped for lunch, there was nothing in sight except for two random mountains and dry grass.

Unlike Ngorongoro Crater and Tanagire National Park, Lake Natron/Ol Doinyo Lengai is less known destination for tourists. For a long time, our jeep was the only car in sight. After driving in this bumpy road for three hours, we finally reached a small Masai village, where we saw Masai giraffes and wildebeests roaming around close by (the animals were closer to our car than they were at the safaris).

Once we arrived on the campsite, the Masai guide took us to the waterfall nearby. <b>Word of advice: don't listen to what the guides say</b>. They describe the trek to the waterfall as a short 30 minute walk with one river crossing. It turned out to be a 45 minutes to an hour walk where we had to be in the water for at least half the time. We had to walk barefoot to save our hiking boots/tennis shoes for volcano hike at night.

After a short nap, we set off to hike Ol Doinyo Lengai (Mountain of God). During the drive to the base of the mountain, our guides told us the hike would only require about 3 hours to summit and 2 hours to descend. Based on this information, we only packed 2 liters of water and minimal snacks for an easy hike.

Did I already say not to listen to the guides? Ol Doinyo Lengai was by far the hardest hike--or the hardest thing--I've done in my life. The mountain stands at 2890m in height, completely covered in carbonatite lava. The first third of the hike was relatively easy: approximately an hour of casually hiking up a trail. As soon as we crossed a ridge, the trail disappeared, and we had to follow our guide closely in between the hardened lava. Walking in ash is deceptively hard. The ash starts to weigh the shoes down, and as we step two steps forward, we probably slid back down a step.

To make matters worse, I didn't even have proper hiking shoes. My Nike Frees didn't give me any traction, and I had no hiking poles to help me out. After three hours of hiking, we hit the steep portion. The guide told us that we still had at least four hours to hike up to the summit. The steep slopes composed of soft carbonatite lava crumbled if too much pressure was applied. Also, if we missed a step and accidentally kicked a rock, it rolled down and hit those climbing beneath us.

Groups based on pace naturally formed at this point. The fast group basically sprinted up the mountain, taking minimal breaks, while I joined the medium-pace group with Ari, KJ, and Kasper. I'm not sure if it was the elevation, the slope, or the ash/lava, but I was out of breath pretty quickly. Relying on two mini-chocolate bars and my 1.5 liters of water, I kept saying to myself, "What would Marshawn Lynch do right now" to keep hiking up the mountain.

Before we made the final trek to the summit, we took a quick nap at a small cave to reach the top in time for the sunrise. The guides did not want to take us to the top too early since it was windy and cold up on top. The last part of the hike was basically rock climbing. I was on all fours, gripping at whatever I could, while being covered in ash and dust.

Towards the top, the guide kept telling us, "the mountain is smoking today." I'm not sure if that was to scare us or encourage us to keep going to the top. The last part was extremely difficult. We were basically crawling our way to the top.

<p class="separator">Once we were at the top, we were sitting on the slopes with our backs to the lava. Every now and then, we could hear booming sounds and saw black lava ooze out of the volcano. Around seven, the sun began to rise and clear the horizon. With Konyagi and Pringles in our hands, we celebrated our accomplishment and stupidity for climbing an active volcano.</p>

<p class="separator">The climb down was much harder than the climb up. I kept slipping and ended up cutting my hand on the hardened lava. As we descended the mountain, the later groups were just about to summit. At this point, most of the groups were dehydrated and hungry (blame the guides for telling us not to bring anything). Thankfully though, all the groups, including the one that spent 18 hours on the mountain, all summited and came back okay. But it was nearing six at night...with a 7 hour drive home awaiting us.</p>
<p class="separator">Before we went home, we had to visit Lake Natron. However, the guides, wanting to watch the world cup, just dropped us off in front of the lake. We saw two white flamingos...and an almost dried up swamp that was supposedly really basic (pH of 10). It was such an anticlimactic end to our journey. I recommend going to Lake Natron first, climbing the volcano at night with plenty of food, and cooling off at the waterfall for any groups traveling to this region in the future!</p>
