## Mt. Meru Hospital

Finally, after learning Swahili for five days, we had a chance to visit Mt. Meru hospital in Arusha and fix medical equipment. The ride there was…interesting to say the least. For some reason, all the tall people who don’t fit in the tiny seats on the bus were crammed to the back with five people per row. Lea didn’t even have a seat so she was sitting on people’s laps...but as we realized later, there were two open seats towards the front of the bus.

Once at the hospital, we were split into groups of four. Our group was assigned to fix an old oxygen concentrator. At first, everything looked to be fine. The flow rate generated by the machine was bit low, but it seemed like an easy fix when compared to other groups whose machines did not even start or blast alarms once turned on.

I was so wrong.

After taking apart the machine, we had no clue what was going on. Although we had covered oxygen concentrators in lecture, looking at the block diagram and trying to fix an old, broken machine was so different. At first, we suspected clogged filters that were dropping the air pressure and flow rate. However, all the tubes we checked were relatively clean. Even after replacing the filters, we couldn’t bring up the pressure. Next, we checked the dead battery that powered up the microcontroller and the zeolite sensors. Replacing the battery, however, only triggered annoying low-pressure indicator alarms.

We had to then open up the motor and take it apart. I’ve never actually taken apart a pneumatic motor so I was nervous. More than electronics and inner-workings of the motor though, the process of taking the motor apart proved to be a harder challenge. The screw bits we were given were too small and kept stripping the screws. Without lubricants we were forced to inevitably strip the screws and force the lids out.

After opening the lids, we figured out that the butterfly flaps were all worn out and bent the other way to release pressure. This was causing a huge drop in the flow rate. Once we put it together though, it stopped working. We thought we broke the motor by adding too much lubricants, but it ended up just being a dead extension cord.

The flow rate was fixed at this point, pumping out nearly 6 liters per minute, but once we put the battery back in, the low pressure sensor kept going off. Also, after doing the oxygen concentration test, we found that the concentration of oxygen was not increased at all. At this point, we are suspecting a zeolite problem and will fix that at the end.

<p style="text-align:center;">Semi-fixed Oxygen Concentrator</p>
After working at the hospital, we had the entire evening to walk around Arusha. We decided to meet at Empire Sports Bar with the DukeEngage LTP group. Before it got dark, we wandered around town to see the monument and ate at Big Bites. It took a long time to get food at this Indian Restaurant, but it was good nonetheless.

Empire Sports Bar was much better than the local bar in front of our house. They played some American music for us, but the other DukeEngage group didn't show up until we had to leave. We took the taxi home, costing us a fortune (a whole $15!), and went to bed early for our trip tomorrow.

## First Fix

Perhaps, depression stage was overdue. I wasn’t feeling well in the morning. Maybe it was the late night celebrations after America moved on from group-stages in the world cup or the cold I might have caught or the malaria pills not mixing well with the food…whatever the reason, I felt very ill throughout the whole day at Mt. Meru Hospital.

Anyways, once we got to the hospital, we began working on the oxygen concentrator that we could not fix last week. Well, this week was no different. We actually ended up breaking the motor. Without thinking, we decided to turn on the motor after removing the caps to diagnose the problem and part of the piston broke up immediately. Embarrassed and disappointed, we stripped the machine for salvageable parts and each began our own new project.

Jason and Sofie worked on a baby scale that had some calibration issues. Ari found a broken microscope with one eyepiece missing and began mapping out a fix for the machine. John was given a really old vacuum pump to experiment with. Meanwhile, one of the doctors gave me a broken equipment to fix right away.

I’m not sure what the name of the equipment is, but it was a small piece of magnifying lens with light to look into the mouth, eyes, and ears. Dr. Fryda initially thought it was a dead battery. However, upon further inspection, I found that the halogen bulb inside was broken. Since we had no halogen lightbulbs, I replaced it with a LED and modified the bottom for a quick, makeshift fix.

The doctors were rather pleased with the fix. Although the LED was not as bright as the halogen light, until they ordered the halogen lightbulb, they said the makeshift fix would suffice.

In the afternoon, I got really sick so I just watched John fix the vacuum pump that has a worn-out seal.
