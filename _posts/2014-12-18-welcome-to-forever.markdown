As 2014 draws to a close, I can't help but wonder what I have accomplished this year. The other day, a scary thought struck me. I already lived a quarter of my life, and yet I have done nothing of importance. Even worse, I don't even know what I want to do.

Maybe that's why I can't stop listening to "Welcome to Forever" by Logic.


<blockquote>This is real life, the only one we get to live. I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give. This is real life, everything we do is legendary. And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery. Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming. Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning. Said this is real life. I used to wonder what if feel like.</blockquote>


In the song, Logic describes his encounter with Nas, whom he idolized growing up, and thinking to himself that he finally made it as Nas quotes his lines. Logic dedicates this song to "anyone with a dream and a realization of what following it means." He later samples Pray from Jay-Z, "Everything I've seen made me everything I am."

What has Junior year taught me?

It's probably that I no longer have any dreams. I pretend to be busy. I pretend to be passionate. I pretend to be someone who has everything figured out. But in reality I have no idea what I'm doing or even what I'm trying to do.

So far all of my goals have been too realistic, grounded in reality. It seemed more like a check-off list: get good grades, get into a good school, get an internship...I may come off as snobbish, and it may very well be that I am too privileged to fully appreciate everything, but nothing I've done so far excites me.

Sure, I've never been one to show much gratitude, let alone any sort of emotion in general. But I really wonder what if feels like to finally achieve it. That requires me to have a goal, purpose in life, and something to work towards.

I used to think that it was helping others. I didn't know what that meant or what form it would take, but it was the only tangible dream I had growing up because that's all I knew. I was extremely fortunate enough to be born into a blessed family. I grew up watching my parents spend their lives at church, volunteering and serving in various ministry roles. Too often though, I saw them struggle with people backstabbing them or returning their love with malice while they poured out their lives onto those in need. Yet, they persevered, and instilled in me the patience that they repeatedly displayed.

Unconsciously, I began to develop this sense of unreasonable responsibility and guilt. I equated contentment with complacency and inaction with injustice. To a certain degree, such an impetus drove me to be like my parents. The downside was that I always pushed myself into difficult situations and dealt with hardships by burying myself with more responsibilities or work to trick myself into thinking that I was doing something for the better.

Through it all, I came to realize that I have become accustomed to trials—whether by looking at my parents’ lives or through the ways I came to deal with hardships. I was afraid of peace. Or very uncomfortable by it, because I wasn’t used to it.

Now I'm a bit lost. Recently, I went through several traumatizing experiences. I've become disillusioned through betrayals and lost relationships. At first, I didn't expect anything in return, but the frustration and anger I felt made me doubt my intentions in helping others. I began to question everything.

I really hope this is a temporary phase though.

I know traveling and service are two things that truly excite me. Although I may know nothing about development work yet, I want to do something with healthcare and development.

In "The Alchemist" Santiago meets Fatima along his journey to fulfill his Personal Legend. He describes Fatima as one who helps him forget everything. She is a symbol of escape from the mundane routines of daily life, personification of the beauty of life and passion, and reminder to slow down and look around. Santiago seeks solace in Fatima, yet she does not deter him from finding his ultimate treasure. One can even argue that Fatima becomes his true gift from his journey as they fall in love in the end.

So as I head off to India, I'm hoping to find my Fatima, whatever it may be for me.
