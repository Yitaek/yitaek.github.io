Saqsaywaman pronounced like sexy women means "fat falcon" in Quechua. Apparently it used to mean the "head of a puma" as Cusco was laid out in the shape of a puma and Saqsaywaman is located at its head. But after the conquistadors attacked the Cusco, they left Incan corpses out on the field near Sawsaywaman. Falcons, vultures, and others of its kind feasted on the dead bodies and became fat, lending this Incan ruin to be named "fat falcon" or Saqsaywaman.

There is a knock-off version of Christ the Redeemer nearby. It was a gift from the Palestinians who used to inhabit the area and decided to return to their homeland about 50 years ago.

After visiting some textile place where locals made things with alpaca wool, we quickly swung by the knock-off Christ the Redeemer statue to take pictures and admire the view of Cusco. Then as the sun descended we drove down to Plaza de Armas and Catedral del Cuzco. Inside the Catedral we were not allowed to take pictures, but the scale of the place was compared to St. Peter's in the Vatican. The place is literally overflowing with gold and silver, so I think the overall monetary value might be even greater. The interesting part is how Roman Catholicism and Andean religion can coexist. The Peruvian version of the Last Supper has Jesus eating guinea pig with his disciples. Jesus hanging on the cross is wearing some fancy skirt that Incan kings used to wear. After mass, people touch some sacred stone that is supposed to cure all illnesses. It was weird to see Catholicism and "pagan religion" blend so well together.

We went back to the hotel early to prepare for the early journey to Machu Pichu. For dinner, I had some alpaca meat. It was cooked too dry so I didn't like it as much, but was exotic nonetheless.
