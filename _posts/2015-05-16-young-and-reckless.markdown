Is it stupidity or youth…or is it the same thing?

Maybe it’s just part of a brilliant plan.

Before this past semester began, everything was well laid-out for me:




  * Get into Duke (check)


  * Pursue BME/ECE dual degree (check)


  * Duke Engage EWH (check)


  * Medical device summer internship (check)


  * Graduate and start working


Success was to be defined by stability. If I just worked hard, found an internship in my junior year, and have a return offer after summer, I was going to have a stable job and be successful. In time I would pay off my debts, start a family, and live a happy life.

Well, life wouldn’t be so fun if it all went according to plan.

Now that I’ve been introduced to the ever-so-exciting and risky world of startups, everything has changed. The fast pace and the interdisciplinary nature of startups appealed to me the most as I always hated repetitive and menial tasks.

I’ve been told that there are two prime windows in which I can jump into this pool: in my 20s when I’m young enough to make mistakes yet bounce back and start over again; and after 50s when my kids are off to college and I have the time and money to afford couple of mistakes.

The question then becomes now or later?

It’s truly a happy dilemma, similar to choosing colleges, as I have several options at the moment. But the more I think about it and the more I talk to people to get some insight, I end up becoming more confused. My friends always remind me that I have too many choices that my life goals change in a matter of days. So I’m just going to scribble some thoughts here for my sanity.

When you look at all the successful entrepreneurs (let’s take Elon Musk for example), you can definitely see an element of insanity and obsession for their goals. For many years, I regarded this as their passion—in other words, something I was missing and was desperately looking for.

After talking to Michael Hoey from NxThera, I have a slightly different outlook on this whole passion ordeal. Michael built his platform technology after losing his father to prostate cancer. When describing his journey to building his company, he stressed the need to build a personal toolbox to be successful. But one thing I noticed from his bullet-point list to make it big was the distinction between passion and vision. Michael began with a vision, then realized his passion, and it all took him more than a decade to see it blossom. Maybe I have a vision, and passion will soon follow as I turn ideas into tangible actions.

First time that I seriously thought about my “vision” was at CGIU with Tony Wang. He asked why I didn’t drop out of school and work on ViFlex full-time. It was a fair question that I’m sure everyone involved with ViFlex has have thought about at one point. How can you run a social venture without passion, and if you are passionate, why not drop everything else and work on it full-time? That’s a different story for another time, but from there, I got to talk to Tony about uncertainty surrounding my passion. I vaguely knew that I wanted to build hospitals in developing countries—mainly from lasting impressions Dr. Paul Farmer, the success of Pencils of Promise, and independent clinicians operating hospitals in Tanzania has had on me—but I had no clue what form that would take. Or why it had to be me physically building a hospital.

As Tony asked follow up questions, I began to realize how my so-called vision was merely a cool idea. Tony noted that it was cool to see a goal driven by altruistic motives, but at the current stage, it would end up being just an idea.

The healthcare industry is complex and filled with extraordinary regulatory challenges. At least in the US, medical device innovation or new drug development takes so much time and money that companies and individuals are encouraged to make modifications on existing models rather than envision completely new devices. One must also consider reimbursement plans, marketing, hospital administration, and patients, on top of simply using technology to improve healthcare.

Tony stressed that due to the intricate and complicate nature of the healthcare industry, to have success, I need to focus on one component of the supply chain. He used Uber as an example to illustrate how Uber disrupted the taxi companies to successfully reorganize the need. He also told me about the emergence of tele-healthcare in China as models that I might follow in my journey.

Some of the others at CGI LEAD also added that I should decide on a scalable goal: one that is not too grand that it is impractical or unimplementable, but it also should not be so trivial that it’s too easy to achieve. They also recommended that I partner with someone to accelerate the process. In the grand scheme of things, I first need to build on a design, lock down on a specific group, and start with a narrow focus. Ultimately, I should be able to solve a specific problem so well that others want to follow.

After this discussion, maybe I began to think that building a hospital may not be the best solution. It may take my entire life to build a Mayo Clinic or Narayana equivalent system in other countries. I lack expertise in so many areas, let alone the capital to build a comprehensive, multi-specialty hospital.

In response to my worries, Tony recommended that I leverage my familiarity with technology and pick a game that will become easier for me over time. For example, I have experience with programming, research, and startup management. I probably won’t become a world-class programmer or Nobel prize winning researcher. However, if I frame the playing field so that it requires seamless integration of all those skills that I’m good at, I will have a better chance of winning the game. I think this idea builds on Michael’s advice on the importance of building a personal toolbox. Essentially this is just personal branding issue. This was extremely helpful for me as I have always lamented the fact that I wasn’t excellent at one thing. Considered a jack of all trades but master of none, I always wondered if I was fated for a life of mediocrity.

At this point, I was set on joining a big medical device company to build some expertise and learn about the industry before quitting to build a medical company on my own. I thought I could disrupt the medical device industry the easiest based on my experiences, and wanted to ride the trend of big companies tapping into developing country healthcare market.

Then I wandered again.

It was just a harmless email from Venture for America recruiting juniors for a full-time offer by April. I had little to no reason to apply. During the interview when they asked “Why is Venture for America right for you,” I had to do some research then and make up some story about my love for startups. (Side note: I’m not sure how these questions are helpful. To me, it was similar to “why X college” questions. Unless you go to the school, it’s next to impossible to assess fit and it becomes a contest of who can stalk their website the best and relate it their life in such an artificial manner…but I digress).

Somehow I managed to get to the final round and was invited for on-site interview in New York. The interview was actually really fun. The intellectual stimulation and the time pressure made it truly exhilarating, as strange as that sounds. The interview aside, I was more interested in talking to the judges (some entrepreneurs and some managers in the financial sector) about my career decisions.

The founder of VFA, Andrew Yang, was extremely helpful in connecting me to people I could benefit from talking about entrepreneurship. The first person I talked to was Lisa Anastos, who was also one of my judges. She is a serial entrepreneur who holds business and law degrees from Wharton and NYU. From consulting to serving as board member for Doctors of the World, and running nonprofit projects to encourage art education, she had such an eclectic experience that was somehow all relevant and related in a strange manner. Her love for art was the common thread that tied all of her various interests and talents together. Perhaps I can apply the same concept in trying to integrate all of my interests/hobbies/dreams/skills.

I also met a JHU BME alum who was now working on software development, who explained that the long development period for medical devices/pharmaceuticals was not appealing to him (something that I may resonate with since I like short-term projects more).

After seeing some engineer's pro/con list on joining either Uber or Zenefits led to the Zenefits CEO publicly rescinding the offer, I should be hesitant on writing about my own indecisiveness on taking the GE or VFA offer. But here’s a list of things that I am asking myself at the moment, if anyone else is going through a similar situation (list compiled by advice from Tony Wang and various medical device entrepreneurs I met at the UMN Conference):




  1. Company environment: I can go into a big company, get trained and learn what it is like to work in an environment with others and different layers of authority, but only if I’m very observant and sensitive to these situations. Many learn about structure, but not enough about management especially when trying to convert that know-how into a smaller company. Conversely, I can join a smaller company, learn about all the possibilities of small startups and the nimble speed of progress. However, most startups fail, and I might end up wasting a couple of years learning how to do things the wrong way.


  2. Interests/Ambitions: Is my goal to eventually work in or co-found a startup? If so, working at a good startup will offer much more experience in a shorter amount of time.


  3. Missing skill-sets: Do I need some structure and traditional knowledge or do I need to break away from a regimented program and see the excitement and opportunity a startup can offer?


  4. Recognizing good opportunities: specifically for startups


    * Is the company fast-growing or quickly making progress in its product development? Is it iterating or reinventing itself/product all the time?


    * Will I be challenged out of my comfort zone (tech skills or people abilities)? Are the people around me more passionate about what they are doing or are they looking for answers?


    * Is the CEO or management, by traditional standards, brilliant? Are they energetic people who are thinking about new solutions everyday?





Hopefully I will have more answers than questions by the end of summer. Stay tuned for more insight!
