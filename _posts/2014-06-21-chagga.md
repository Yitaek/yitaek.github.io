Alex had organized a day trip for us to go to some coffee farm and visit the Chagga caves. We drove to Moshi (1-2 hr away), stopped at Halai Hotel where we met up with some more guides and took a bathroom break (key word clean bathroom), and drove for about 40 more minutes to near the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro.

The coffee farm was more like a banana tree farm. The type of coffee they grow needs cooler temperatures and shade so the coffee bushes are scattered around the banana trees, avocado trees, and guava trees. The native people, Chagga, showed us their village inside the farm. The children were playing some sort of dodgeball. They also had cows, pigs, and chickens. The pens for the animals were so small, it made those pro-vegetarian videos look almost silly. All the animals were fed avocados and banana leaves.

After going through the village, we went near the Chagga caves to make coffee for ourselves. The coffee beans were not yet ripe so we used some of the beans they had saved up. The people in the mountains used a traditional way to make coffee.

Here’s the process told in pictures:

<span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;">In between roasting the coffee beans, we had a lot of downtime to play with the chameleons and the turtles that were just lying around. I’m not sure if the turtles were native or they were brought in though.</span>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140621_110232.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140621_110232.jpg?w=225" alt="20140621_110232" width="225" height="300" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140621_105843.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-84 alignright" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140621_105843.jpg?w=300" alt="20140621_105843" width="300" height="225" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;">First, the caves are dug in a zig-zag manner to trap light inside and keep the noise of cattle undetected from the outside. The entrance is kept dark with several hidden posts guarded by the Chagga warriors. Since the Masai people do not know the layout of the caves, they bring in lamps, which immediately exposes them to the guards. Once inside, the Chagga warriors would knock out the few enemies carrying the torches and speak in Masai tongue to tell the rest to watch out for low ceilings and crouch. This exposes the necks of the ducked soldiers and the Chagga warriors can then easily decapitate them using blunt weapons. The dead bodies of the Masai would be carried to the river 4km away through the caves/tunnel and chopped off to hide what happened. Also, the weaker soldiers would be kept as slaves to clear cattle dung and keep the rooms tidy. </span>Once the coffee was ready, the group split up into two to tour the Chagga caves. The Chagga caves were built as a defensive mechanism from the Masai attacks during dry seasons. The guide explained that Mt. Kilimanjaro somehow affects the climate in a way that after 35-40 years of regular wet climate, there are 3-4 years of extremely dry times. In those times, the Masai would eventually make their way up the mountain and raid the indigenous Chagga people for food, water, cattle, and take the people as slaves. At first, they only took food, but as time went on they killed off all the males, took the women to force them into sex slavery for the warriors. So the Chagga people started digging the caves as a hideout. The caves are designed extremely well to withstand attacks and to live for years underground.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Once the Masai figured out that their people were dying as soon as they went inside, they tried to drown the Chagga during the wet season. However, the Chagga built the caves in a way so that water would drain out to the rivers easily. Next they tried to choke them out by biochemical weapons (tobacco mixed with hot chili smoke). The Chagga blocked off the smoke using cow skin and was able to survive. They had ventilations chambers in each room where they dug underneath trees and bushes so such tunnels were undetected from above. Also, the Chagga could use fire inside without being detected because they put layers of volcanic rocks in layers above their cooking chambers to filter out the smoke so it would be invisible once the smoke was filtered out.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you want to visit this cave, watch out for bats that fly around inside (the locals actually breed them to keep out insects in the cave) and don’t bring backpacks inside as it will get muddy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140621_130013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20140621_130013.jpg?w=225" alt="20140621_130013" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After the cave tour, we had some time to enjoy the coffee that we made, along with sugar and chocolate crème cookies. The locals really like their coffee and tea sweet, so don’t be surprised if they are dumping spoonfuls of sugar and add a whole carton of milk to their coffee.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Before coming home, we stopped a house to learn how to cook local food. Actually, I was too hungry and invested in talking to our guides that I only watched from time to time how the beans and the banana dish was cooked. Traditional Tanzanian food is mostly just rice and beans. I wish I had some spices or kimchi to eat the bland food, but with avocadoes and sweet bananas afterwards, I became used to the taste.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At night, Mama Glory spoiled us with fried tilapia and baked crème potatoes. It was nice to have some fish after eating rice, beans, and some sort of combination of fruits and chicken for the past week.</p>
