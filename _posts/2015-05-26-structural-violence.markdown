Gary Haugen elaborates on the failures of foreign aid groups in addressing the lack of law enforcement, which he explains is the root of poverty in developing countries. He illustrates the plight of these people living outside the protection of the law--most vividly, through an example of fresh water organizations "responding" to the issue of girls getting raped on their way to fetching water by moving the wells closer to their homes.

Through years of supporting organizations that approach solving poverty by building infrastructure and providing education, I lost sight of where it all began for me. I saw firsthand how structural violence in place perpetuates sex trafficking in SE Asia, specifically in Thailand and Myanmar. I still receive updates from the Dela Paz family who runs an orphanage in northern Thailand to keep the children safe, and I talk to Thae, who was our guide/host during our visit to Mae Sai.

In college, my interest and focus turned to healthcare to address the same issues. But in the process, perhaps I may have lost that human aspect to my mission. Gary Haugen focused on _compassion _in his speech, and in immersing myself in the technical side of things, I wonder if I have been focusing too much on my _passion _instead of driving myself with _compassion. _

Another quick interesting point: the speaker is a member of IJM. Back in Freshmen year, I wrote an essay about how neo-abolitionism, which IJM embodies, actually operates as structural violence and oppresses sex trafficking victims and sex workers alike. Law enforcement to address poverty necessarily draws parallels to how IJM worked to eradicate sex trafficking with brothel raids and heavy punitive measures. I haven't done enough research about poverty--or sex trafficking since I wrote the essay for that matter--to formulate more thoughts, but I thought it was worth pointing out.
