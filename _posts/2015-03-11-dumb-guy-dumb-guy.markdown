_dumb guy dumb guy yitaek_



Lately I've been really clumsy--making stupid mistakes--I'm wondering if there are holes in my brains now.



I just sat in the wrong seat on my flight to Lima, causing a whole ordeal with confused flight attendants and other travelers who only spoke Spanish.



I'm not sure where the phrase dumb guy started (I think it was when I was absolutely convinced that 1/4.7 was a bigger number than 2.5 on one of the BME homework sets...and starting arguing with a friend), but it has stuck around. In the bumper pool community, I started using "____ guy" as people's nicknames. I didn't know other people also knew me as "dumb guy dumb guy Yitaek."



It was brought up the other day over dinner when a friend told me I overuse the term as if I want people to tell me I'm smart. She accused me of humble bragging and labeled me basic at the same time. Ouch.



Welp, I don't want to be really known as dumb guy or the token smart Asian kid.



The same friend also asked me what word I would use to describe myself.



I couldn't really give an answer right away. I don't think I have a defining quality. I would like to think that I've lived an interesting life, different than most. But when I look back, I've just become mediocre at a lot of things but don't really have one thing I'm known for. Call me jack of all trades and master of none. I guess it's a nice way of saying, "he has no clue what he's doing."



After some thought, I decided I wanted to be known as different. I didn't want to fit into the Duke mold: either become a doctor or be successful in the finance/banking industry. Ideally, I would want to disappear for a year or two, travel and do some soul searching after graduation. No, I'm not a hippie or a hipster. And I don't mean this with a "I'm better than you" attitude. At the moment, I'm wrapped up in a travel lust that I don't want to miss this chance before I'm too old.



(Side note: I need to make a conscious effort to be humble. I know I've become a bit arrogant and sometimes "I'm better than you" attitude manifests itself. Maybe I'm saying dumb guy because I'm actually humble bragging and need that attention. After all I was accused of attention-seeking for excessively posting on Facebook about my India trip from a close friend.)







Anyways, before my trip to Miami, I didn't really have a plan after traveling. I vaguely knew that I wanted to build a hospital in developing countries after my experiences in Tanzania, but I never had fleshed out my idea. Part of it was laziness, lack of time, and not knowing where to begin. But the biggest reason was because I didn’t know if “this was it.” I was delaying my search and not putting much effort to it because I wasn’t sure what I was passionate about.



I've always wondered at what point I would know that what I am doing is the right thing. Something I'm actually passionate about--things that keep me awake at night and keep me motivated to work.



I may have been looking for the wrong thing.



Over the weekend, I had a chance to attend Clinton Global Initiative conference held in Miami. Representing ViFlex, I worked with several mentors, including Tony Wang from Three W International. After talking about ViFlex and how he could help us grow, I started asking him more personal questions. Based on his track record of starting new companies and eventually settling on Three W International that made him Forbes 30 under 30, I asked him at what point he knew creating services for exchange students was going to be big, and that it was something he was passionate about.



His initial response was something I expected: it was bit of a mix of luck and background experiences. His parents worked at private schools, arranging exchange programs in Canada. When Tony began his startup, policy changes were encouraging more Chinese students to come to the US.



What intrigued me was when he said he still doesn’t know if he has reached that point yet where he can definitely say that Three W International is what I perceived to be his passion.



He then asked me why I will be interning at GE Healthcare. To be honest, I wasn’t really interested in imaging until this year. Yea, I’m now taking two imaging courses and absolutely love the material, but applying and taking the internship at GE was solely because I was caving to the Duke pressure of getting an internship as early as possible and figuring out my summer plans.



Tony tried to stay impartial, but he hinted that if I were to join a big company, I would end up being sucked into it and always saying, “I will quit once I make X amount of money or become X position to finally do the things I love.” At this point, I was bit scared that I would become a hypocrite and end up like that. Telling people I want to establish some sort of nonprofit to serve the underprivileged but actually living that 9 to 5 grind, middle-class life with dreams of one day having enough courage to quit the job. (Not that such a lifestyle is bad. I'm just saying I've been telling others I would be different that if I were to settle into the norm, I would be a hypocrite.)



I didn’t understand how Tony could be working so hard to run his company, while not entirely convinced that it was his passion. How could he spend so much of his energy at something he may end up realizing that he doesn't like it at all? Maybe I was just delaying taking my first steps towards accomplishing my dreams because I was simply too scared. I wasn’t sure what I was so scared of though.



Perhaps it’s the fear of never actually finding my passion?



But I'm starting to think that some people are never meant to find their passion. To them, the journey to find their quest is actually the quest itself? Does that make any sense?

Since then, I have been trying to make more concrete goals for my future. I’ve gathered together a list of things that my friends tell me often:






	
  1. I’m not sure what excites you. I can’t really figure you out.

	
  2. It seems like you are doing a million things. You can’t be just dabbling on things. Usually when people do something, they pour their hearts out…but with you, I’m not sure. It’s not like you are bad at it though.

	
  3. You tell me you aren’t doing this for the money or want to become a sellout. I can totally see you drop out and disappear into nowhere.





I’m not sure what these tell me. But I know some things for certain. I no longer want to start a nonprofit. Asking for money with ViFlex, I’ve realized that with nonprofits, you are so limited by the donors. With my venture, I want to have more control and make an impact the way I envision it.



Also, Tony told me to make the game easier for myself. I may never be the world champion in individual fields that I am “decent” at, but I can shape the competition to cater to a conglomeration of all of my strengths.



Well, after all this time, I am still indecisive and unsure of my future. As I lay down my first value proposition table though, I am starting to cross off things I do not want.



No, I’m not a dumb guy. I’m just a bit different.
