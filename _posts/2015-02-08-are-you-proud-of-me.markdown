_Only guarantee in life is death so I'm kind of scared, to be honest with you
__I ain't making the best decisions
__Not every move I'm making is made with the best intentions
__And yeah I'm far from perfect but I'm tired of overusing that excuse
__Who am I to complain when most of my time is misused?_




_So I wonder
__Are you proud of me?_




_Crazy thing about stars is they don't shine until they die
__And I'm sick of wishing and hoping
__I feel like as of late I'm just going through all the motions
__How selfish of me trying to be more than a waste of life
__Just know, no matter what I'm gonna be great because I have to
__If I wrote that letter I was supposed to I would've asked you_




_Are you proud of me?Â _


Lately I've been stuck in a dilemma.

I hate the idea of doing nothing. Even when there is nothing pressing to be done, I catch myself looking for things to do. I can't stand still in a sense that I have an innate fear or strong aversion for boredom. Or maybe I get a high from being busy and feeling productive. I'm happier when I'm busy.

But I don't want to be known as a busy guy.

Last semester, I took a lighter load expecting the internship search to be time-intensive. I was fortunate enough to find one earlier on and spent rest of the semester looking for things to do. I joined multiple clubs, took on different roles, but ended up not really investing myself into them.

This semester, I overloaded to get back into the rhythm of studying. But I think last semester's attitude carried over. I applied for the Grand Challenge Scholar program, was accepted, but have yet to really reach out to my mentor and start on my project of building a diagnostic tool for detecting retinal diseases and prescription.

But then again, I find myself trying to not look so busy, going to Chapel Hill on a Thursday night to celebrate friend's 21st birthday. Then on the weekend I lock myself on the third floor of Gross Chem to catch up on work.

I'm not sure what I'm doing here.

I wonder what Tarik meant when he described "trying to be more than a waste of life" being selfish. Am I being selfish if I'm just going through all the motions for the sake of being busy?

It would all be easier if I knew what I was passionate about. I've been asking others what they were passionate about, but collective response so far has been "I'm not sure." Maybe all dream die as you grow older. Maybe they just get drowned out in the hectic routines of life.

Maybe that's why stars don't shine until they die.

But for all I know, this is just one of those beats I get lost in.
