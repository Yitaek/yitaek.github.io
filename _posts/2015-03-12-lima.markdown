I don't feel like I'm in Peru at all.

Perhaps it's because after India and Tanzania, any hotel with AC and wifi is considered luxurious for me. Also, the fact that my hotel is located in a district (miraflores) where condos cost $300,000 and has fancy malls with numerous American stores including Popeyes (seriously, what?!?) doesn't help either.

Anyways, since the purpose of this trip isn't some deep soul-searching or volunteering, I'm just mostly going to post pictures. This is another way of me saying that I'm lazy and don't want to spend time trying to write well over spring break.

The tour began at Huaca Pucllana, which is just a massive step pyramid yet to be fully unearthed by archaeologists. We didn't get to walk around the site and actually explore, but the place was humongous (I would recommend checking it out if you have time).




From there, we proceeded to Cathedral of Lima. The guides were not kidding when they talked about churches in Peru being one of the richest. Everything was plated with gold and silver. Underneath the church was a catacomb where beneficiaries were honored...now in the form of ashes and bones mixed with limestone.

From there, we walked towards the center of Lima. Plaza Mayor marks the center of Peru. It is surrounded by Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco, city hall, monastery, and other historic buildings (including the one with KFC in it).

On the way back to the hotel, we swung by love beach and parque de amor. There was a huge sculpture of people making out, where couples would compete for who can kiss their partner the longest on every Valentines Day (apparently it lasts for 6+ hours).

For lunch, my brother and I decided to try some traditional Peruvian dishes: Guinea pig and cerviche. Guinea pig tasted bit like beef jerky, and cerviche was sashimi drenched in lemon sauce.

In the afternoon, we visited Larco Museum. It was owned by a family who happened to buy land that included seven step pyramids. The family decided to excavate the artifacts and preserve them unlike others who just demolished it for more farming land.

Besides the intricate pottery, the museum laid out in great detail about how the sacrifice process went: when the dry season would come, the priest would anoint warriors to fight. Each warrior would wear a helmet and whoever knocked off the opponent's helmet would win. The loser would be tied up for a week, fed a fruit with anticoagulant, and eventually sacrificed on top of the alter (head was chopped off).

The most interesting exhibit at the museum, however, was the erotic sculpture section. Apparently the pre-Incan Peruvians believed that sex was an important part of life carried out by the gods in above and the dead below.

For dinner, I had rice with seafood with wine from Argentina. I personally liked it much more than cerviche.
