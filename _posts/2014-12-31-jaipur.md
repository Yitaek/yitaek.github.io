## Namaste

Should I call it hubris or laziness? Other than namaste (which I only know from GTA), I do not know a single phrase in Hindi. I always have this, “it’ll work out” mentality that may just be a product of <del>me avoiding pre-formed complexes as described in Walker Percy’s Lost Creature</del> my extreme laziness or unfounded optimism.

Anyways, I managed to find my way around the airport and safely find my luggage at Jaipur airport. I took a taxi and led the driver to the “address” of my homestay family that I saved onto the phone.

India reminds me a lot of Tanzania. They both drive on the left side of the road, and more importantly, there are no such thing as street names. My taxi driver could not find the house, got lost, and dropped me off at a nearby location. Thankfully, he called the homestay family for me and waited until the brother came to pick me up on his motorbike.

I am staying with the Yadav family. The dad is a lawyer who doesn’t speak much English, but he tries to make a lot of jokes. When I am eating or drinking tea, he asks if I asked him to eat with him first. He also thinks he is now a teenager since he is now friends with me.

When I arrived, there was another girl volunteer from Malaysia. She had just arrived the night before, so we took a stroll around town to explore. I don’t know what I was expecting, but there wasn’t much. All the streets looked the same: spray painted advertisements, cows roaming around, trash piles, debris laying around, and vendors riding motorbikes and camels.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141220_212833.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-276" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141220_212833.jpg?w=300" alt="20141220_212833" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
The noise level is crazy. Everyone honks to tell people to get out of the way, to let the other car know someone is coming in a blind spot, or to just simply greet others. I wish I understood more Hindi. Once I was in a rickshaw and apparently the driver was telling others if they didn’t move, he would hit them with a stick.

For rest of the day, the host brother Dron decided to give us a quick tour of Jaipur. He first had to attend his university student government meeting so he dropped us off at his friend’s house. They were preparing for the Jaipur cultural theater festival in January. Although I couldn’t understand much, they seemed really passionate about expressing their love for Rajasthan and their culture through the songs and dances.

Later, Dron drove us up the hills next to Amber Fort. On the way up, we witnessed a motorbike crash. One of the motorbike drivers rear-ended the bike in the front. The husband who was driving the front motorbike got out and started swinging his helmet at the other driver for disrespecting his. The fight became violent quickly as the other driver picked up a brick to fight back. Dron seemed to enjoy it quite a bit as he called it “very India.”

After this brief encounter, Dron dropped us off at his secret hangout spot overlooking the entire city. Skipping rocks down the hills, we started talking about random things from American culture to politics. The topic shifted to Michael Brown case for some reason, then Dron told us about how he is a political activist who has been to jail 10-12 times already. India seems like Korea 20-30 years ago from what I’ve heard from my parents.

My first day here has been pleasant. Only thing is that I am not used to this food here. Everyone is vegetarian…I personally don’t like anything too sweet or too spicy, but I will have to do with all the spices for the next two weeks.

## Narayana Hospital & pk

Jaipur Narayana Hospital is a corporate hospital that opened merely four years ago. It boasts 250 beds including 80 in the ICU and one emergency operating theater. Although the facilities are not as advanced as US hospitals, the equipment and patient care seem proficient. 

Before I was assigned to my role, I had to go through a little orientation about the hospital model. The founder of Narayana was a heart surgeon who had a vision for providing adequate healthcare for the poor. Since this was exactly what I wanted to learn about, I was excited to ask how Narayana achieved this goal.

The hospitals runs under the PPP Model: Public Private Partnership. Corporate and private hospitals partner with governmental hospitals that provide cheap healthcare. Narayana prided itself in building a hospital aimed at serving the poor rather than building hospital for the rich and also admitting poor patients from time to time.

Several years ago, the Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative passed. In my understanding, this is Indian version of the Obamacare (I may be wrong since I don’t fully understand Obamacare and could not understand Hindi-English spoken by Dr. Vinay.) Since medical insurance is not compulsory, many Indians do not have insurance. To address this issue, hospitals offer micro-health insurance plans which only costs 18 rupees a month (about $0.25). Also, Narayana conduct medical camps in the slums to reach out to those unable to even pay that micro-health insurance fee. The funding for these medical camps come from banks and big corporations in return for free health checkup for their employees from Narayana doctors.

An interesting aside: 61% of the employees are female at Narayana. Dr. Vinay was really proud of this statistic. I wonder if this number is skewed by the huge number of underpaid housekeeping members.

I tried to find out more about the financial and operation side of the hospital, but soon language barrier took over. Also, I thought it would be too rude to delve too deep on my first day, especially with a doctor who heads the research department. After a brief interview covering my knowledge and experience shadowing doctors, I was assigned to six different departments (physiotherapy, dialysis, emergency, general ward, preventative medicine, and ICU). I wanted to work with ophthalmology and orthopedic/prosthetic department, but those specialty doctors only worked certain hours.

After visiting each department and introducing myself, it was already four o’clock. Most doctors finished their rounds and started heading home. Along with other volunteers at the hospital, I went to a nearby mall to watch a Bollywood movie. I expected English subtitles, but I guess I was expecting too much. I watched pk and I had no clue what was going on half the time. I thought the main character was someone who had a traumatic brain damage, looking for a god. Apparently, he was an alien looking for his remote to return back to his spaceship. It seemed like a satire on religion, but I can’t be sure.

<img class=" size-medium wp-image-278 aligncenter" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141222_001935.jpg?w=300" alt="20141222_001935" width="300" height="169" />

On the bright side, there was some wifi at the movie theater and chicken dumplings. I don’t think I’ve appreciate meat so much in my life…and it’s only been like two days.

## Doctor or Engineer ???

I shouldn’t have introduced myself as a biomedical engineer. The doctors are all confused why an engineer is shadowing a doctor. I tried explaining that I am a biomedical engineering student interested in medical equipment, thus observing patient-care to think of ways to improve healthcare and medical technology. Every time, the doctors go, “In India, you have two careers: doctor or engineer. So are you a medical student or an engineer?” At first, I said I was an engineer. Then, the doctors began testing me on the equipment: how does the ventilator work, what does MRI stand for, etc. I didn’t want to go through this trouble again, so I began introducing myself as a premed student unsure of what department to work for after graduation. Things went much more smoothly after that.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141224_160308.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-281" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141224_160308.jpg?w=300" alt="20141224_160308" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
On the first day, I worked in the physiotherapy department. I expected patients rehabbing and learning about TMT and TENS machines, but to my surprise, I was taken on an ICU round. Well, I’m not sure if I can really call it an ICU. The medical ICU and Cardiac ICU are connected. It is “separated” from rest of the hospital with a changing room, where the doors are not closed and sanitation protocols are ignored. Nurses and visitors alike reuse dirty shoe covers, and doctors sometimes forget to wear ICU slippers or shoe covers upon entering. At the very least though, everyone wears masks and head covers in the MICU. Still, everyone was taking these protocols lightly and simply going through the motions.

The physiotherapist visits each patient, as requested by the ICU nurses, to check their cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. First, they check the vital sign monitor for irregularities in blood pressure, pulse, heart rate, and SpO2 levels. For CCU patients, respirometer is given to test and strengthen breathing, and for all patients, simple exercises are prescribed to prevent bedsores and muscle atrophy. A special massage is provided to old or immobile patients.

The biggest takeaway from my rounds in the MICU/CCU was that physiotherapy is more about cardiovascular health than musculoskeletal health. To improve blood absorption of medicine, lungs and airways have to be clear of mucus.

Other things I noticed:

1) Patients find finger probes uncomfortable, finding less abrasive or more integrated probes

2) Manual splitting cups/trays are often out of reach for patients, could be attached onto the bed

3) All medical charts are hand-written. Digitalizing them onto a tablet may save paper and messy paperwork.

After MICU/CCU rounds, the doctor headed to the pediatric ICU. Here, he acted as the primary doctor, overseeing nurses and stabilizing the babies. I guess physiotherapists are also general physicians in India (or maybe he was a special case?).

Once the rounds were completed, the doctor returned to his office and interns attended patients in the physiotherapy department. Since there were no patients before lunch, I decided to ask the doctor about healthcare systems in India. I’m not sure if it was a language issue, but the doctor seemed hesitant in answering my questions. At one point, he said, “I think you are interviewing me for a new job.” When asked about medical technology he would like to see in the future, he responded by emphasizing the need for neural and cardiac machines. He hinted at the need for tissue engineering, especially artificial livers.

During my lunch break, I visited the biomedical department located in the corner of the hospital. Two technicians headed the department. Although the office and the workshop were small, it was very organized with manuals, new parts, and broken machines properly labeled. Apparently Dr. Vinay introduced me as a biomedical guru, so the head technician proceeded to ask me about repairing a microcontroller on the ultrasound machine.

It’s a bit sad that I had no idea what was wrong…I shouldn’t let anyone know that I’m also majoring in ECE. Disappointed and in sudden doubt, the head technician began testing my knowledge and questioning my credibility. He asked me about flow sensors in anesthesia machines and how oxygen concentrators worked. Thankfully, I had some experience working with those two in Tanzania, so I was allowed to work with them.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141224_142522.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-285" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141224_142522.jpg?w=300" alt="20141224_142522" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141224_142514.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-286" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141224_142514.jpg?w=300" alt="20141224_142514" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
I later found out that Narayana hired technicians from TriMedex company. The two technicians routinely repair the linearity sensor on anesthesia machines, flow meter on ventilators, and maintain vital sign monitors and autoclaves. There were tons of new equipment to be installed, so broken equipment were simply replaced rather than repaired. However, there was one anesthesia machine without replacement parts that I was able to diagnose the circuit problem and solder the loose connection together.

In the afternoon, I just watched the interns treat couple of patients. TENS – transelectrical nerve stimulation – was given to cardiac surgery patient who had a coronary bypass; a patient who had undergone reconstructive ACL surgery went through continuous passive motion therapy.

## Christmas in ICU

<span style="font-size:1.0625rem;line-height:1.5;">I spent my Christmas morning in the ICU. </span>

Although most Indians are Hindu/Muslim, Christmas is still a holiday. Most of the hospital was empty with only emergency and ICU rooms fully staffed. Even the housekeeping crew took the day off, so I had trouble finding clean scrubs to enter MICU. The “clean” scrubs I received, however, seemed still dirty/contaminated—perhaps there’s a problem with the autoclaves or the staff was too lazy to actually find me new/clean ones.

I noticed something funny while roaming around the storage units. In all rooms, there’s a sign that reads, “No storage bins shall be placed within 18 inches from the sprinklers.” In a country that uses the metric system, this sign must be straight up copied from the United States. I wonder if this rule is actually enforced here.

I made the mistake of introducing myself as an engineer again today…so the doctor told one of the interns to explain to me how each machine works in the ICU. Starting from the vital sign monitor (including every excruciating detail about BP, SpO2 saturation rate, etc) to every tool on the crash cart, the intern went through the machines as if he was reading some manual.

To give him some credit, here’s a summary of what he told me. In the CCU, the vital sign monitor measures arterial blood pressure as well to more accurately monitor cardiovascular health. On the crash cart, there is a biphasic defibrillator with ECG capabilities, alcohol swab, blood tubes, IV cannula, ECG electrodes, scalpel blades, laryngoscopes, and drawers full of emergency drugs. Every morning, the defibrillator is checked for functionality and the expiration dates for the drugs are checked thoroughly.

The rest of the day, the intern left me alone to play around with the ventilator. There were only three patients in the ICU today, so after going through the ICU charts and trying to decipher whether or not the writings were in cursive or in Hindi, I took a break to eat cake and celebrate Christmas with the doctors.

In the afternoon, I visited JKSMS Orphanage with other volunteers. In a small two-story complex, there were about 25 - 30 boys between ages 6 – 18 crammed into bunk beds. The boys were flying kites on the roof, playing a mysterious game with chess pieces, and dancing to Hindi tunes. Every interaction with the kids went something like this: the kids would ask me for my name, then stuck in trying to formulate a sentence in English they would randomly shout “Merry Christmas!” Still, as time went on and as we played more musical chairs together, I was glad to spend my Christmas with them.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_163817.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-289" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_163817.jpg?w=300" alt="20141225_163817" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_161345.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-290" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_161345.jpg?w=300" alt="20141225_161345" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_150646.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-291" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_150646.jpg?w=300" alt="20141225_150646" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_150622.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-292" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/20141225_150622.jpg?w=300" alt="20141225_150622" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
Later, girls from the other orphanage came over. The whole place was chaotic. In the front, there was cake and Indian delicacies being served (with Indian Santa leading the charge by cutting the cake), in the back a mad dance session ensued, and on the side, the girls were playing with balloons. It was touching to see the older kids giving out candy to the younger ones, wishing them a merry Christmas.

One thing that bothered me was another volunteer holding up the kids and taking the typical I’m-a-volunteer-look-I’m-saving-the-world Facebook profile picture. I had a chance to talk to her earlier, and she said she was volunteering at the orphanage in hopes of getting into medical school. At first, I was slightly judging her for her “wrong” intentions of coming to India, but later I caught myself taking picture of the children playing games without asking for their permission or asking the administrators. Who am I to judge others? For all I know, this trip may be me boosting my resume as well regardless of how I framed it as.

Once the dance party died down, with three other medical volunteers, I headed to Gaurav Tower for a more proper Christmas celebration. Actually, I was just sick of vegetarian food, and wanted chicken for dinner. I wanted to eat at a fancy sit-down restaurant, but it was hard enough finding a non-veg restaurant in Rajasthan. In front of Gaurav Tower, there was a huge Christmas festival with giant lit-up trees and winter-themed parades going on.

Unable to find a restaurant, I settled on going to the food court inside the mall to eat at KFC. Unfortunately, the mall had a couples-only entrance policy on the first floor, so I could not even get into the mall. I didn’t think I would get denied entry into a mall…I guess in India Christmas celebrations at the mall is like a frat party. Anyhow, I just waited for a huge crowd to push through and snuck into the mall.

Quick aside: I don’t understand the security system in India. Everywhere there is a metal detector/scanner, but people are patted down by male/female officers depending on the gender. Also, people freely enter through the exit while the officers are not looking, so there is no point in having such a tight “security” system in crowded area.

I don’t think I’ve ever been so grateful for KFC. Sure, it wasn’t a proper Chik-fil-A or Bojangles chicken dinner with sweet tea, but the crispy taste of chicken after couple days of eating grass and chapatti was glorious. Listening to some creepy version of Christmas carols, I happily chowed down a six-piece meal.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img-20150103-wa0000.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-265" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img-20150103-wa0000.jpg?w=225" alt="IMG-20150103-WA0000" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
Who would have thought I would be eating KFC on Christmas?

## Boss in the ECG Room

The doctors at Narayana are starting to recognize me. Maybe it’s because I’m clearly not Indian or the fact that I’m a confused engineer/pre-med intern or since I am conducting preference survey and demonstrating ViFlex prototypes in English when most patients I talk to can only speak Hindi (I probably come off as a crazy Asian kid trying to sell glasses).

Today, I was supposed to learn how TMT, ECG, and echocardiograms worked. But the doctors wanted to talk about US education system, Hollywood movies, and girls more than trying to show me the machines. There was an intern/technician called Sandeep. The senior doctors described him as “the boss” in broken English. At first, I didn’t understand what that meant.

Let me tell you about the boss. Sandeep delegated most of the ECG duties to other technicians when a male patient would come in for a reading. But if it was a younger female patient, he would kindly direct her into the ECG room, passionately describe how the ECG machine works, and proceed to flirt with her.

Other than noting how Welch cups were not properly cleaned between each use, I learned little about ECGs. Sandeep was more interested in my love life, and more importantly, trying to get the phone number of another female volunteer at Narayana.

In the afternoon, I stopped by the biomedical department to see if the anesthesia machine we fixed previously was put back in service. The English-speaking technician wasn’t there, so I didn’t get to check. But communicating with hand motions and universal engineering terms (I mean pointing at soldering iron and making melting gestures), I soldered couple wires together to replace power plugs for stand lamps and telephones with the other technician.

After the technician went home early, I returned to the preventative medicine department to see doctors use echocardiogram machines. Sandeep didn’t know how to use the echo machine, so I didn’t get to listen to more his various dating stories. The doctor actually using the echo machine had a heavy accent, so I had a hard time understanding him. The only thing I noticed was how the patients had to lie down sideways for more accurate readings. It might be helpful to design beds specifically for the echocardiogram or make better probes so the patients can lie down straight.

In the evening, other volunteers in Jaipur invited us to Pizza Hut. Jumping at my opportunity to eat chicken two nights in a row, I gulfed down a triple-chicken pizza and cheese paneers. Right after though, I had a huge stomachache as if my stomach could no longer handle high amounts of protein after all-vegetarian diet for the past couple of days. With an upset stomach, I walked around the Pink City as other volunteers shopped for sarees.

Must have been karma for wanting chicken so much.

## Jaipur City

<p style="text-align:left;">On Sunday, we explored Jaipur City, also known as the Pink City. The first stop was Hawa Mahal, characterized by its delicate windows. However, it is located in the middle of the busy street, so we didn't get to take a good look.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_104134.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-316 aligncenter" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_104134.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_104134" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The next stop was City Palace, including Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal, sitting at the edge of the city. Like Agra Fort, the City Palace is humongous. You can also ride elephants up to the top, but beware of the long wait and may need prior reservations to assure the ride.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_114645.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-317" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_114645.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_114645" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_114637.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-318" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_114637.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_114637" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_112010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-319" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_112010.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_112010" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_111730.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-320" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_111730.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_111730" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The view from the top of City Palace is absolutely breathtaking. It tricks you into thinking that you are in the middle of a desert, and looking out onto wilderness, when in reality, the heavily populated city is just on the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_120542.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-321" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_120542.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_120542" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_115512.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-322" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_115512.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_115512" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_115043.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-323" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_115043.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_115043" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_115038.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-324" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141228_115038.jpg?w=300" alt="20141228_115038" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After descending from the City Palace, one can see Jal Mahal (Water Palace) floating in the middle of Sagar Lake. Access to the palace itself is now restricted, but the picnic area around the Jal Mahal is nice.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The last stop was Jantar Mantar, an ancient sundial and astrology center. I don't understand the science behind the sundials and how precise it is, but the fact that such giant figures inhabit in the middle of the Pink City tells you how important it was for the people in the area.</p>

## Um Do You Speak English?

Life in the hospital is a struggle when no one speaks English. The doctors stationed in the general ward are generally reserved, and the nurses barely speak any English. I awkwardly walked around the ward, looking through the files, realizing once again I can’t read cursive or recognize any medical terminology, and stood behind doctors when they talked to the patients as if I understood something.

After a while, I got bored so I began looking for things to do. The first thing I noticed was the patient paging system. Since EWH chapter at Duke is currently modifying the patient-nurse paging system (PNPS) installed in Kibosho Hospital by Ari and John, I wanted to see how things were different in India. Narayana is fairly modern, so I’m guessing it’s the same way in the US.

The telephone wires and wires to the smaller button are hooked up to the wall. The remote contains reset button, nurse-paging button, and call/video chat options. However, only the nurse-paging button was wired with the other two ports left open. Throughout the whole day, I did not see a single patient using PNPS. First, the remotes are mounted to the wall and never given to the patients. This may be because all the patients in the general ward are able to move and reach the wall mount with relative ease if needed. Also, the doctors explained that in India, female members of the family usually don’t work, so they can be by the bedside and call the nurses. Lastly, the general ward is pretty small, so the staff at the central nursing station could easily monitor all the patients without the PNPS.

This led me to question the need for PNPS in the general ward. Perhaps this is more useful in the ICU and in the US, where family members can’t always be with the patient. Maybe this is an example of medical technology adopted without taking cultural factors into account. I thought it might be useful to have a paging system for the housekeeping staff instead. The nurses often shouted “housekeeping” to mop the floors, replace water jugs, and clean out sheets. A simple rerouting of the wires can fix this issue and will make the PNPS more useful.

Other things I noticed were rusty clamps for IV stands and hand sanitizer holders. Instead of using clamps, utilizing small portable table equipped with sphygmomanometers, pulse oximeters, and vital sign monitors or modifying the bed to have foldable table to rest such machines might save space and speed up set up time.

After thoroughly reading each patient files and noticing interesting sections such as patient education pages, I ran out of things to do. The doctors did not want to entertain me like Sandeep did, and the patients kept asking me things in Hindi I didn’t understand. So in the afternoon, I decided to continue doing some field-testing for ViFlex.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141207_160849.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-270" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141207_160849.jpg?w=300" alt="20141207_160849" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141207_160833.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-271" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141207_160833.jpg?w=300" alt="20141207_160833" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
Once again, language barrier proved to be a huge challenge. I would approach anyone wearing glasses and ask if they spoke some English. At first, they mistook me as a doctor asking for feedback of the service, because I was wearing my lab coat. Later, they thought I was a reporter for a foreign news agency and kept referring me to others to talk to.

Despite the struggle, I managed to gather quality data. Older people preferred thin metallic frames with gold or silver colored sleeves for the sidearms. Younger generation preferred and wore black or brown/wood-colored polycarbonate or “hipster” glasses. Another thing I noticed were preferences for thicker sidearms, which allowed for more stylistic choices. I saw various designs, colors, and decorations on the sidearms. Many middle-aged people wore glasses with no rims or glasses with frames on the tops only. With regards to the design of the current ViFlex prototype, if we are able to thin down the lens holders and increase the thickness of the sidearms, we can cater to the younger generation who need prescription glasses. I believe the metallic frame preferences for the older generation is a result of VisionSpring or other organizations distributing such styles. But when shown our design, most people were positive of it, assuming they understood my English and my hand gestures of “good” or “bad” with thumbs up and down.

I also asked people to assemble the glasses after demonstrating it once. This was only done with people who could speak better English. So there was a age-bias (tested on people between ages 20 – 35), and I was not able to do blind tests where I would ask them to assemble it without me showing it to them beforehand. Still, the results were encouraging. All the people thought the process was simple and intuitive. However, they complained about the horizontal stability of the glasses, which can be improved by adjusting the sidearm lengths (but not many people did that until I reminded them again so that may be a problem), and nosepiece adjusting wasn’t as smooth as we expected. Although it was a small population sample, I was thrilled to confirm market acceptance of the glasses’ utility and aesthetics, if I may conclude prematurely.

## Dr. Yitaek Hwang

I had a semi-mid-college crisis today. I wanted to quit engineering and become a doctor. Maybe it’s because I started introducing myself as a premed student, or the fact that I enjoyed my time at emergency room so much.

Thankfully the doctor on-call at the emergency room for the day spoke English fluently. He showed me several interesting cases in the past week: trauma cases, punctured lungs, cerebral palsy, and alcohol poisoning accidents. Between 10 and 11, the ER was mostly empty so I walked around, reading all the signs posted around the room.

Three interesting observations:

1 – The patients are categorized by the triage system based on severity of the health condition. All the patients I saw throughout the day already had paperwork with triage categorization completed with the billing statement. Those who did not have proper paperwork, usually missing the payment plan, were turned back from the ER, albeit most of their symptoms were not life threatening. Does this mean that paperwork is filled out over phone or online inside the ambulance? That is unlikely because I barely saw any ambulances; family members usually drove the patients to the ER. I did see a lot of patients coming in for side effects or complications after surgeries, so maybe admission process went faster for re-admittance?

2 – Narayana Hospital posters containing health acronyms, hygiene reminder messages, and safety protocols only had pictures of Caucasian nurses and doctors. It was odd, considering Narayana was started in India, to not see any Indian figures on those posters. Maybe they are using stock pictures and photoshopping the Narayana logo on top of it…or maybe it is a case of implicit racism?

3 – None of the doctors used x-ray stands even thought they were conveniently placed around the ER. Instead they just held the x-ray pictures against the light to see clearly. I wonder if this is a case of convenience, user error, or saving power.

Around 11, patients started filing in. The first patient had SpO2 level below 20 with low blood pressure, gasping for air. He was immediately hooked up to the ventilator, but SpO2 level did not improve. He was sent to get an x-ray, and it showed lungs leaking with air. The doctor transferred him to the CCU, but the patient died within 30 minutes. Apparently, he was a chronic smoker with previous history of lung problems.

The next patient came in with severe lower abdominal pain. After conducting several quick tests, the doctor ruled out ruptured appendix and suspected kidney stones. He was given painkillers and sent for further testing. At the same time, an older woman came in with low SpO2 level. She had infections in the lungs and history of pneumonia. She needed to be sent to the CCU, but all the beds were full, so she was sent to the other hospital. The situation seemed urgent, but doctor and family members alike did not appear rushed at all.

Next several cases were either yellow or green triage patients. One college student came in from a motorcycle accident with lacerations all over his body, bleeding in the head, and fractured collarbone. A family holding a crying baby with stomach flu walked in next to get medication. Another man needed catheter removal after surgery (not sure why he came to the ER instead of the procedure room). The most interesting case was a homeless-looking man with no one accompanying him. He did not speak Hindi or was not speaking clearly as the doctor called for a translator of some sort. He had abnormal BP and slightly low SpO2 levels. Weirdly though, after taking ECG readings, he suddenly got better. They did use a pulse oximeter instead of the vital sign monitor after the ECG, so it might have been machine error. The doctor prescribed rest and waited for further testing.

Right before lunch, a young female patient was rushed in. She was vomiting continuously without complaining about nausea. She fell unconscious within minutes and needed oxygen support, while having her vomit sucked out simultaneously. She had a stage 5 HD with pneumonia before (not sure what that means, but it sounded serious) and had right cervical swelling. The ECG readings displayed normal results, so the doctor suspected meningitis or complications from prolonged seizures and wanted MRI immediately.

Rest of the day, patients slowly filed out or were transferred to respective ICUs. I really liked working at the ER. Unlike other departments, it was busy most of the day, the doctor needed a breadth of knowledge to respond quickly, and I could see immediate results. I had a brief span of maybe 30 minutes where I contemplated becoming a doctor and working in the ER. General physicians and doctors stationed in the ER are probably most needed in rural regions as well, which was most appealing to me.

After the doctor on call went to take a rest, I looked through the ER log. There were significantly more male patients admitted in the ER than female patients. Also, most of the older patients (70+) were mostly female. Majority of patients came in for cardiac diseases with ECG and RBS being the two most common testing procedures. Since the Rajasthan diet involves heavy use of sugar and oil, I could guess that cardiac problems resulted from dietary habits—at least partially. As for the disparity in number of male and females, I couldn’t point to a single factor, but thought it was interesting note regarding gender roles in India.

At night, I made noodles with other volunteers at the homestay. I feel like ramen at midnight has mysterious psychological powers that draw people together—or it’s just a result of circumstances that call for ramen or series of conditioning from ramen nights at retreats and in college. I understand that ramen has little to do with this post about working in the ER, but I guess I’m trying to express my nostalgia for home as 2014 draws to a close.

## #foreveralone

Today was the last day of 2014 and my last day at Narayana Hospital. For the past week and a half, I had a chance to work in six different departments, shadowing doctors and doing minor device repairs with the BMET department from time to time. Before coming to India, I expected to be stationed in a rural, almost-dilapidated hospital with poor healthcare services. However, Narayana provided adequate healthcare (despite minor sterilization violations) and even had talented biomedical technicians for equipment repair. Still, my time at the hospital was valuable. It was my first time shadowing doctors, and I gained useful information on healthcare programs in India, medical devices in service and in need, and ideas to improve current models and design new equipment fitting for its culture and location.

The final day, however, was rather boring. I was stationed at the dialysis room, expecting to learn a lot about the machines and tap into why dialysis machines are in such high demand in Jaipur. To much of my disappointment, none of the doctors or nurses spoke English. They were nice enough to show me a Wikipedia page on dialysis and the manual for the dialysis machine they were using.

The patients came in three waves: 7 am, 11:30 am, and 4 pm. The entire process takes four hours to complete, and those with chronic kidney failure must come three times a week for dialysis treatment. Since all the patients were regulars, the patients came in to take their own weight and BP measurements. The nurses joked around with them, while they prepared gauze strips and tubes to hook up to the machine.

According to the Wikipedia article, dialysis machine mixes and monitors the dialysate that purifies the blood. Blood taken from the body and the dialysate run in opposite directions to maximize concentration gradient driving force for diffusion. Dialysate is composed of solution A (acidified electrolytes and minerals), B (bicarbonate), and purified water. Buckets containing these solutions lay in the bottom compartment of the dialysis machine.

I read a great deal about dangers on using dialysis machines for people with low blood pressure, need for heparin to prevent blood from clotting, and carefully maintaining air traps to prevent air bubbles in the tubes. But when I asked the technicians about these issues, they seemed not to know—or it could have been that they didn’t understand me. Also, when the alarms went off from various concentration sensors and flow meters, the nurses largely ignored them and simply tapped the reset button. I’m not sure if this is due to laziness or from developing a habit after becoming annoyed by minor warnings that aren’t critical for patient’s health during dialysis.

In the afternoon, I stopped by the BMET room to replace ventilator flow sensors and run linear calibration tests on IV machines. The main technician was on leave for the holiday, so the other intern let me work independently. The fixes seemed a bit pointless though, since repaired machines rarely went back in service; they simply replaced them with new machines most of the time.

To celebrate NYE, I made plans to meet up with other volunteers around the area. However, convincing the host family to let us stay out for the countdown was not so easy. Although my host family is relatively tolerant, the host father warned us about the plethora of drunk drivers and police crackdowns on publicly intoxicated foreigners. After assuring that none of us were alcoholics, we headed to a different host family to first get mandi (similar to henna) and went onto the Peacock Restaurant.

The entire place was filled with Caucasian tourists/volunteers. I felt like I was at an Indian restaurant in America. A middle-aged Belgium volunteer (John) and a grad student from Emory studying public health were already waiting for us. By the time we sat down, John had already finished three 750ml bottles of King Fisher, Indian version of Natty Ice. It is unclear whether he was drunk or not, but his stories were absolutely hilarious. From complaining about being woken up at 5:30 am everyday and doing nothing until breakfast until 10 am and waiting to start the day at 11 am to his strange experience at gender-segregated club, John eagerly spilled all of his strange adventures in Jaipur so far. The whole night, he tried convincing us to drive to Delhi to leave the vegetarian and 10 pm curfew life behind, but by the time other Italian volunteers showed up, we had only an hour before 2015 began.

Did I already mention that getting into malls was like trying to get into a frat party uninvited? Well, it was even worse on NYE for clubs and pubs. At least the mall was free; some of these clubs asked for a cover charge of $100 for singles. Of course, couples had it much cheaper. Every “classy” place we tried, either a rich guy had already rented out the entire place or no one was inside due to high prices.

Right before the clock hit midnight, we settled on a shady local club. As soon as we walked in, a fight broke out on the stairs, as drunken men wrestled each other, yelling and swinging punches. Inside was worse. The ratio of guys and girls was probably like 999 to 1. Immediately after we entered the room, all the guys in the club swarmed our lone female volunteer until the Italians girls rescued us half an hour later. It was only after this night that I understood why segregated clubs exist in India. Couples-only access makes sense after all.

The countdown celebration itself was so anticlimactic. I lost track of time and drowned out by random Hindi/English pop and house music mix, I actually missed the countdown and start of 2015. Although I did not expect to celebrate new years with family and friends, I was nevertheless feeling quite lonely surrounded by mostly random people who wanted to take pictures and change their Facebook profile picture with a caption “look I met an Asian dude on NYE.”

No fireworks. No new years kisses. Just Indian version of Natty Ice.

Quite a tragic beginning to 2015.

## Shrestha

If 2014 ended on a disappointing note, 2015 could not start any better. I was scheduled to visit the Shrestha center to conduct a medical camp with several other volunteers and local doctors. My “role” during the medical camp simply consisted of recording name, measuring height and weight, and lining up the kids to get checked by doctors. Shrestha is located in the middle of the slums. The building is quite eerie as more than 30 kids are packed in a small basement with dim lighting. It made JKSMS Orphanage that I visited on Christmas look decent.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_134459.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-260" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_134459.jpg?w=300" alt="20150101_134459" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
As the doctors prescribed cough syrup and did simple dental checkups (including brushing their teeth as tooth brushing is a luxury for the kids), I walked around the room to notice their drawings and new years decorations. Some of them were interesting: a “fat Jesus” drawing and a hipster Santa Christmas tree. At first, I was hesitant to approach the kids, fearing another abrupt end to the conversation after “hi, what’s your name? "
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_113759.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-259" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_113759.jpg?w=300" alt="20150101_113759" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_114740.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-262 aligncenter" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_114740.jpg?w=300" alt="20150101_114740" width="300" height="169" /></a>

<a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_114041.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-263 aligncenter" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150101_114041.jpg?w=300" alt="20150101_114041" width="300" height="169" /></a>

The kids were really welcoming, regardless of the fact that I couldn’t speak any Hindi. One by one, they would come up and introduce themselves, then running out of things to say, ask me for my name again. Soon we got comfortable enough to expand our range of vocabulary to family members. The kids loved it when I would call other Indian volunteers my father, mother, and brother. I started zapping them and tickling them to play around. As time went on, they formed teams amongst their favorite volunteers, pointing at them to claim “me, you, best team; they bad team…boo~”
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img-20150103-wa0009.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-266" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img-20150103-wa0009.jpg?w=225" alt="IMG-20150103-WA0009" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
As always, a dance party ensued. First, an older kid wearing a sideways beanie started break-dancing. While others tumbled and did handstands to impress us, a huge dance circle formed. One by one, all the volunteers were called out to dance, and all of us had so much fun. I don’t think I’ve been so genuinely happy.

The kids poured out their love for us. At a certain point, the language barrier and age difference became irrelevant. The periodic “what’s my name” was enough to make us laugh. I was truly blessed to spend my new years filled with love and pure joy. Surrounded by the kids, I began to envy Belgium John who works with the kids every day. If possible, I want to spend all of my vacation time doing care programs in the future like John. Nothing compares to the bliss that arises from spending time with neglected kids.

After lunch, we played cricket and soccer. I had no clue how cricket worked even after one of the volunteers, who by the way was part of the American U-15 cricket team, explained it to me multiple times. While running away from kids trying to hang onto my arms and jump onto my back, I started a soccer game on the side. The kids barely knew any of the rules, but the competitive edge was there nonetheless. I don’t think I’ve ever played harder or ran so much, fully displaying my nonexistent messi-like soccer skills. Every time I dove for the ball and as all my clothes became covered in dirt and cow/goat dung mix, kids laughed and boo-ed me. So I had to respond by scoring goals and screaming “gooooalll” like a Mexican announcer on FIFA.

To the moment we stepped into our taxis to head home, the kids gave us unrelenting love. The never-ending “what’s your name” and “happy new year” and poking and zapping me and running away…everything felt like a dream. The only question I couldn’t answer was “will you come tomorrow?”
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img-20150106-wa0002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-268" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img-20150106-wa0002.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG-20150106-WA0002" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
That night, we also celebrated one of the volunteers last day in India. I’m not sure if it was lasting effects of our time at Shrestha, but every little thing made us happy. I would giggle hysterically even at the dumbest jokes. Laying down on the rooftop and gazing at the star, we laughed and cherished our time together. It truly was the perfect beginning to 2015.

## Ayurvedic Hospital & Chokhi Dhani Village

Ayurvedic medicine is an alternative form of medicine that has its roots in the Hindu tradition. It has eight components - general medicine, treatment of children, surgery, ophthalmology, treatment of the cause, antidotes, rejuvenation, and progeny - but is mostly known for use of herbs and lifestyle changes to treat the disease holistically.

I had a chance to visit National Institute of Ayurveda in Jaipur to compare the standard of care in more Western-style, private hospitals to traditional, public hospitals. The professor working at the institute first took us to a caged herbal farm. He explained that monkeys eat all the herbs, so the farm must be protected by heavy metal cages. Then, he took us around the entire school from museum of herbs and minerals to manufacturing facilities. Contrary to my prior misconception that Ayurvedic medicine only consist of herbs, the "doctors" there prescribed uses of semiprecious stones and corals to treat symptoms and provide calcium to the patients. The professor displayed an attitude of defensiveness and a need to prove the effectiveness of Ayurveda to us. He claimed that the reason Ayurveda fails is because patients give up on long, holistic treatment too early, the supply of precious herbs are too small compared to the demand, and that herbs available on the market is usually contaminated with other plants. To test for authenticity, he showed how to identify proper color changes when the herb was placed in milk.

The rest of the institute was a giant public hospital. The hospital itself had some modern tools, specifically used for diagnosis (ophthalmology department for example), but most of the hospital still relied on traditional techniques such as using leeches for treatment. It was shocking to see poor levels of hygiene, even worse than protocols I saw in Tanzania. The operating theater was just a room closed off by a wooden door. There were no such thing as sterile or even clean zones. Patients walking by the rooms could see and hear surgeries.

Actually, I expected the standard of care in India to be similar to the ones offered at the Ayurveda Institute. I guess I was mistaken in two ways. The rise of corporate hospital in recent years have made it more popular than traditional Ayurvedic hospitals, barring cost considerations. Also, I expected to fix more medical equipment in these settings, but there is absolutely no use for BMETs here, simply because there aren't any tools to be repaired.

The institute, however, had an interesting department not typically offered in Western-hospitals. It was technically called the detoxification department, but it was a combination of physiotherapy, massage, and sauna. Here the patients underwent herbal steamed baths, massages, and internal cleaning using herbal laxatives and cleansers.

In the afternoon, the group celebrated the last day together at Chokhi Dhani Village. It is basically a recreated cultural heritage site where performers provide folk entertainment, jyotish (astrology), mehendi, and Rajasthani food. Although the puppet shows, traditional dances, magic shows, tight rope riding, and other performances were "interesting," I kept feeling bad for the performers who live off tips, selling their culture for entertainment. To me, at least, the village repressed the sorrows of poverty and the struggles of the daily grind of these people rather than the joy of sharing their colorful culture. I wonder if it is ethical to even build such <em>heritage sites. </em>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150102_175211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-295" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150102_175211.jpg?w=300" alt="20150102_175211" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Maybe it was my lack of interest in learning about the culture, but I didn't enjoy Chokhi Dhani village at all. I wouldn't recommend it to tourists who might go on packaged tours here. "Culture" can better be seen in the streets than in pre-staged villages. Also, beware of the vendors who will take advantage of you. I was largely turned off by people trying to make it a business rather than celebrating their heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At night, I attempted to fly a kite on the roof. In preparation for the Kite Festival, which will be held on January 14th, all the kids were flying their kites. It looked so simple and fun, but just getting the kite up in the air for couple seconds was a struggle. I guess I just don't have a talent for kite-flying. The hundreds of kites covering the night sky seemed to mock me all night long.</p>

## Rajasthan Traveling

To be honest, I didn't enjoy traveling in Rajasthan that much. I went to the elephant sanctuary, Abhaneri Step Well, and Galtaji/Monkey Temple. I planned on going to Ajmer and Pushkar, but realized after two days of traveling that I didn't really care about religious sites and heavily marketed tourist attractions. So this post will be mostly pictures, in case you want a sneak peak of the places I visited.

Apparently I don't know how to spell elephant. At the sanctuary, you can feed, wash, draw/decorate, and ride the elephants. There were three college students from UF, Berkeley, and Duke (obviously) and we ended up covering the elephant with rival drawings/writings.

Chand Baori or Abhaneri Step Well is quite imposing.

One advice: don't get a guide/translator as he will overcharge you and take you local quilt shops afterwards. The visit is sufficient with a quick search on Google to find its history. In the dry season, you can't really make out the well and the water is covered in algae.

Galtaji is actually a pilgrimage site that is overrun with monkeys. <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_153805.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-339" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_153805.jpg?w=300" alt="20150104_153805" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_152731.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-340" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_152731.jpg?w=300" alt="20150104_152731" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_152714.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-341" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_152714.jpg?w=300" alt="20150104_152714" width="300" height="169" /></a> <a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_152527.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-342" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150104_152527.jpg?w=300" alt="20150104_152527" width="300" height="169" /></a>

The temple itself isn't as impressive as the forts or palaces in Agra and Jaipur City, but the view on the top of the hill is worth the visit.

You can also see people bathe in the dirty water.

## Real Rajasthan Experience

My internship at Narayana Hospital technically ended last week; however, after my excursion trips yesterday and realizing I am not really interested in learning about Hindu or religious sites, I decided to go back to the hospital and work at the BMET department the entire day.

In the morning, I followed the technician on his daily rounds to identify and note broken equipment in all the departments. In contrast to last week when I was a pretend premed student, I had access to all the backrooms and even got to observe a plastic surgery to treat a burn. Although the BMET department in Narayana is small, it had a well-established system. The nurses reported to the main technician about malfunctions with ABG (arterial blood gas) machines and some software issue in the EP (electrophysiology) lab.

While the main technician called St. Jude Medical for the EP issue, I looked around the workspace to note all the equipment in use. Narayana boasted fairly modern equipment from GE, Phillips, Nipro &amp; Fresnius (dialysis machines), Stryker, St. Jude Medical, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and several other smaller medical device companies. There is little use for a biomedical engineer at corporate hospitals in India. Most of them can afford to call for specialized technicians from the companies located in Delhi, and have plenty of replacement parts to repair machines on their own.

Instead, I had a chance to work with a specialist from Roche to repair ABG machines in MICU, OT, and ITU. The first machine had a clog in the chloride filter. After running calibration tests, the technician pulled out the port modules to decontaminate the electrolyte openings with a silicon thread. Then, internal cleaning process was run to remove all the blood clots. Most of the machine was automated to run self-diagnosis and recalibrate itself after simple cleaning protocols.

Once again though, the technician largely ignored sterilization protocols. He reused dirty shoe covers, did not remove the ABG machine from MICU, did not wear masks or head covers, and was careless with the needles, dripping blood on the ground. Also, the silicon thread used for cleaning was reused multiple times. Sometimes he would override the contamination warning errors after carelessly cleaning the ports. At least in the OT, he wore proper scrubs and removed the machine.

In the evening, I attended the first Rajasthani Theater Festival that my host brother Dron had planned. The program consisted of a musical piece, a talk by an influential Rajasthani figure, and a play that embodied its culture. The first exhibit, Jaipur Beats, was a performance by a fusion band. My host sister Daksha explained how traditional Rajasthani music characteristically has a distinct feel from what foreigners view as Hindi, Bollywood-style music. The lyrics all had to do with how colorful and beautiful Rajasthan is, and how the singer's lover should join him in Jaipur.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150105_171342.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-302" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150105_171342.jpg?w=300" alt="20150105_171342" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The second piece was a talk by Dr. D. R. Mehta, the founder of Jaipur Foot. The man is simply amazing. He provides modern prosthetics limbs for free to 65,000 patients each year. The prosthetic legs and knees are not of bad quality either; his $45 replacement limb is marked by lightness and mobility that compares to $12,000 limb made in the US. The $20 Jaipur Knee is even more impressive: it is flexible and stable due to its self-lubricating nylon design. When asked how he operates a $3.5M business/NGO without ever charging the patients, he replied that he lives off compassion and the satisfaction he gains from providing his services. Jaipur Foot operates with a surprisingly low 4% overhead costs (compared to 20% in most NGOs), which stems from Dr. Mehta's belief in instituting a culture that does not allow for using funds for any other purpose than for their core objective. He concluded the talk with a quote from Dr. Albert Schweitzer, "Let us all join the fraternity of those who bear the mark of pain. Before I die, I hope to prostrate before his burial in Gabon, West Africa."</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">His focus on compassion and ultimate goal to serve the community Africa, when he himself lives in the developing world, was something I could not comprehend immediately. I think he best summarized his reason and drive for doing what he does in this, "The minute you start instituting a charge for your service, the most vulnerable population are the first sector of society to be marginalized, and it's precisely this sector of society you wish to serve the most."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150105_191013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-304" src="https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20150105_191013.jpg?w=300" alt="20150105_191013" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The final act was a play by local theater majors. It described a silly encounter between Jaipur residents and Ganesha, the wisdom god who has a head of an elephant. At first, the people of Jaipur prepare for the arrival of the king and worship Ganesha. All religions, spanning from Hindu to Islam, celebrate the joys and pains of life together at weddings, funerals, feasts, and social gatherings. As they worship Ganesha, what they don't realize is that he had been with them all along, asking for a way to get to Jaipur. The people largely neglect Ganesha (disguised as a human) and later learn about their mistakes when Ganesha reveals his true identity in front of the king. I thought it was interesting to see acceptance of different religions and collaboration of diverse cultures in the play, and in the lives of the people here, given the history of castes and conflicts with Pakistan.</p>

*** Note: both talks by Dr. Mehta and summary of this play is my creative understanding through my host sister's translation, so it may not be 100% correct ***

It was only on this last day that I got a glimpse of true Rajasthani culture.
