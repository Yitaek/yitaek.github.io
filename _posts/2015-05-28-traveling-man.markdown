Here comes a long overdue post-China trip reflection post. Even after reading through the daily scribbles I kept throughout the trip, I was still left wondering, "Why did I go to China?"

It wasn't supposed to happen. I remember playing cards with other homestay kids in India when this friend asked if I wanted to go to China with her. I'm still not quite sure what made me say yes. Was it the travel lust, a mere whimsical decision, or something else? Whatever the reason, this trip was possibly the most confusing one I've taken so far.

But it was just as meaningful as my "purposefully planned" trips.

And if I had to describe this trip in one word, I would choose _closure. _

The day after I returned from China, I deleted a personal blog that I had kept. Some time ago, one of the freshmen in my fraternity told me that I sound extremely sad on my blogposts. This was from just reading this one--not even my personal one where I rant from time to time. It came as a shock to me, because at that point, I believed that I was all over things and finally _me_ again.

It's been roughly a year since everything changed.

To be honest, after coming back from Tanzania, the travel lust was not just motivated by my pure love for traveling. It was my self-defense mechanism to escape and run away from reality. I didn't want to go home, whether that meant Duke or Seattle. India, Miami, Peru, Minneapolis, New York, and now China...all have been my way of avoiding the problem at hand.

Looking back, Tanzania has been both my biggest horror and best time of my life. As ironic as it is, it still stands true to this day. I've been grappling with how that could be. Maybe that's just the way it is: something must go for better things to come by.

_Forgive and Forget_

Personally, I think forgiving is easy. But forgetting...that takes real strength. Forgiveness exposes vulnerability where the hurt remains until forgetting happens. But that void left behind just becomes a constant reminder unless you actively erase it from memory or replace it with something else.

Until now, I've taken the first approach. I may call it repression?

But I should have taken the latter approach all along.

At one point on the trip, I had a chance to be alone (_read: forced to explore on my own_). I reached out to the same homestay friends whom I played cards with India, asking why I was in China and if I made a mistake going there. Here's what someone said:

_"You're in China to see China because you like traveling...If you had something that much better to do, you wouldn't have gone to China in the first place."_

Maybe it's a subtle and unnoticeable point to everyone else, but to me, it resonated deeply. From sometime my escape mechanism had turned into my true joy. It had begun to fill the void.

I started this blog, vowing to find my own Fatima, finding my personal legend, and following the footsteps Santiago took. Maybe it was a coincidence, but the friend I traveled with in China was also reading _The Alchemist. _

From passing conversations to personality tests, I began to recover parts of me that I had hidden or lost within myself. To erase the memories in Tanzania, I consciously tried to reinvent myself so that no one who knew me before would recognize me. In this process of forgetting and trying to run away, I lost my identity.

In China, I recovered the little things: My tendency to take on a persona to test people before opening up in Shanghai; the love for daring acts to over compensate for stability and tranquility granted to me in Hangzhou; conflicting life values that somehow still live in harmony at the Yellow Mountain; my selfishness in wanting to live a comfortable life while dedicating my life for others at Thousand Island Lake; and my obsession with Fatima...pretty much everywhere.

Time in China was...weird...for the lack of a better word. During the day, time seemed to go by so slow. It would feel as if we had done nothing, but at night, we would all be so exhausted. I felt like I was in Hangzhou and Shanghai for so long, but when it was time for me to board that airplane back home, I couldn't believe how fast everything had gone by.

I noted in the letter I wrote, but I'm truly grateful for this trip. It might have felt like everything was so spontaneous, unplanned, and unorganized (which it certainly was), God had a plan for me all along. Many thanks to Jiajia for the invitation and helping me with the recovery/closure process even if she didn't realize that she was part of it.

A year ago, I lost a piece of me. Something that I didn't even know what it was. But on this trip, I finally found a _replacement_ for it.

And that's why I am and continue to be a traveling man.
