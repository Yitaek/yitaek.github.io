_**Day 1**_

I should stop pre-buying breakfast. I either oversleep or in this case, I wasn't sure if breakfast was 7 am Helsinki time or Stockholm time, and didn't want to find out so I snooze until it was time to get off the boat.

The public transport system is top-notch in Stockholm. It's like Helsinki with people checking your tickets. Everyone speaks some English, and if you need to get around, all you need is to hop on the 76 bus. For convenience, I ended up buying the 72 hour travel pass, but everything is so close, and the city itself is so beautiful to warrant walking everywhere.

Stockholm is a city made of 14 different islands, with the literal meaning of log island. Local legend has it that Estonian pirates invaded the old Sweden town, so the people carved out a log and put all their treasures, and decided where that log drifted to will be the location of their new town. Believe it or not that log is said to have arrived in Gamla Stan (Old Town), the heart of current day Stockholm.

After eating lunch in Old Town (I recommend Tradition - the lunch menu is not too pricy and comes in a three-course meal), I headed to Sodermalm to explore SoFo area as recommended by friends who have stayed in Stockholm. Sodermalm was described to me as a hipster town, but to be honest, it felt like any other European town to me: overpriced pubs, fancy old buildings, beautiful churches, and good view of the ocean. But apparently there is a 8 - 12 year waiting list to get one of the cheaper, government leased apartments... I mean the weather was so nice during the time I was here, but I don't if waiting 10 years is worth it to live at a place where winters are terrible with only six hours of sunlight.

Side note: all of the islands of Stockholm have basic names. Djurgarden means animal garden, and another one where the navy was stationed is called ship island.

I luckily joined in on one of the free walking tours as I was exploring by myself. The tour guide was a lady from Manchester. It seems weird to have non-Swedish tour guides, but her accent was amusing enough. The first thing she mentioned were rowing madams who used to own the water taxi business. Apparently they were mostly drunk sailors who scared off customers... Thank god for modern inventions or I would never cross the ocean to visit all these other islands. Big, angry, drunk, swearing ladies are intimidating.

Near the top of the hill is a church with a gruesome story attached to it. A 12 year old boy, who had his mother executed for witchcraft, had moved into this town and started a mob of youngsters for a citywide witch hunt. About 14 women were burned at the stakes at this time, and the boy was said to threaten local women for accusing them of witchcraft and took money to spare their life for another day. Eventually though the boy was caught for making up the whole story, and he was burned alive as well. From this came a tradition similar to Halloween where children now dress up and go trick or treating the night before Good Friday. It's probably something that the tour guides know, but not the locals.

At the end of the park with the church is a street named after Master Mikael. He was the town executioner. It's quite odd to have a street named after an executioner. The ironic thing is though, Master Mikael was accused of stabbing his friend and was executed by his apprentice.


[![master](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/master.jpg?w=168)](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/master.jpg)


On the way back, there was a little lemonade stand run by two little Swedish boys. The tour guide kept encouraging us to help out young entrepreneurs, and all I could think about was mark Cuban on Shark Tank talking about how he used to hussle as a child.

Another weird thing about Sweden...people are sunbathing in the graveyard. The tour guide explained that there is a law that allows people to use any piece of public land, so people are encouraged to use all the space whenever it's nice out. Still it was odd to me that people were chilling in the graveyard.

As it is a tradition to take fika or coffee break in the middle of the day, I walked into a hipster looking coffee shop and ordered myself coffee. But I was too poor to order any pastries so my cookie of choice was choco pie. (I think choco pie is the best snack in the world...it is literally everywhere and has saved me from hunger in China, Russia, and Europe!)


[![fika](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/fika.jpg?w=168)](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/fika.jpg)

After fika, I joined the old town tour, this time headed by a Swedish man (I wonder if I would have liked these tours more if they were done by beautiful Swedish girls...like where are the pretty girls that my friends told me about?).

Stockholm is marketing itself very heavily as the "capital of Scandinavia." I'm not sure if it was the product of generational cultural branding or nationalistic pride, but this guide started off the tour by announcing that Sweden was the first country in the world to have a national bank. He was really proud and went on to say that it was the first country to use paper money. Then someone in the crowd corrected him by saying it was the Chinese. I guess tour guides can lie...or have misinformation.

To be honest, this tour guide was pretty boring. He went deep into the history and politics of the Swedish Empire, but I was so tired that I ended up taking some pictures and zoning out.

But here were some of the things I managed to pick out from the tour:




  1. Swedes have an irrational fear of wolves. If you want political power, just have your platform based on getting rid of the wolves.


  2. Swedes complain about the cold weather, and then they all moved to Minnesota...


  3. Sweden's road to riches was by selling arms to both sides of the war (WWII). Spared from destruction while maintaining neutrality, they then sold timber and iron after the war to those countries in need of resources. They still make a lot of weapons. I'm not sure how ethical this is.


  4. Old Parliament building used to be painted red, but when red paint became prevalent, it was no longer associated with being the royal color. Now the building is painted yellow/gold.


  5. A lot of the royal tombs have been dug up for research.


  6. The most famous king is King Zlatan Ibrahimovic (jk I made that one up)


The guide said some names in Swedish but I couldn't really transcribe it so I'm going to skip all the history lessons I had on the day. But one thing I can tell you is that in Sweden, there's a recurring theme of churches burning down often.

The only cool part of the trip was when he took us in front of the Nobel Museum Square to tell us a story that he thinks inspired the Red Wedding (after all George Martin had a minor in Scandinavian history). After the Danish army besieged Stockholm, the Swedes finally gave up their city and enthroned Christian the Second as king. However, he had a drinking problem so on the third day of the party, he killed all the nobility at that square. I guess Scandinavia was a cold, sad place to live back then.

Although the tour itself was boring, I met this couple from Germany, a girl going to dental school in LA, and a Russian girl on a no-return-date trip after breaking up with her boyfriend. The German couple kept trying to say Siemens was better than GE, and the Russian girl was trying to sell me a tourist friendly offline map app. The American girl was super shy, so didn't get to know her much. Still, after long days of traveling alone with no one to talk to, human interaction was a good thing.

Traditional Swedish food consists of herring and meatballs. I didn't really want to eat meatballs, so I opted for herring. It's probably the only cheap food you will find in all of Stockholm. Dinner was only for 60 SEK! If you want this deal, go to Slussen T-bana and look for a canteen with the fish sign on top.

The night ended on a trip to Fotografiska with the Russian and American girl. I don't think my right brain is developed yet to understand modern art/photography. The exhibition just had a lot of naked girls and flowers or the combination of both. The description said it was supposed to inspire fashion, but I didn't understand at all. Maybe it's trying to bring out the inner beauty of women and liberating them, but who knows. I did enjoy Nick Brandt's exhibition on Across the Ravaged Land. I can't believe he saw so much more in some of the places I've visited as well. When I searched for Lake Natron (on my trip to Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania), Nick Brandt's picture actually came up. During our visit to the lake, we saw nothing but some flamingos. I'm not sure where Brandt found all the petrified animals. The last exhibition was dedicated to Zorn, whose blurry photography (which looked worse than my phone pictures) was supposed to inspire art of the moving image. Maybe if I take some AMES classes I would understand...but it was just bunch of blurry pictures and more naked women. But I guess I'm bit more cultured after the visit. The view of the river fantastic even if you don't like photography or can't appreciate it like me.

The way back to the hostel was a struggle. The bus driver drove the wrong way, but the stop description updated as if he was going the right direction. So I got off at the opposite stop and was confused for a long time. Traveling is a struggle.

_**Day 2**_

It's official. Australians are everywhere in Europe. The free walking tour guy for the day was an Australian man, who met a Swedish girl studying abroad in Amsterdam. In his words, as he was learning some Swedish, his girlfriend told him three words that forced him to move to Stockholm: "I am pregnant."

The tour guide then took us around the city, narrating Swedish history in his eyes. The first stop was the Royal Opera. Here, Gustav the Third died at a masquerade party held by the nobles who hated him for taking away their powers. Gustav III apparently loved parties and didn't think he could die, because he was the king....sounds like teenagers nowadays.

As we passed by H&M headquarters, the tour guide gave us his tips on learning Swedish fast: read the IKEA catalog and remember the street names where H&M is located. Apparently IKEA likes to name their heavy furniture after Swedish kings/notable figures, while naming rugs that go underneath the heavy furniture with Danish ones. As you can tell, there is still some animosity between the Swedes and the Danes as I figure out more in Denmark later.

Next we turned into a corner to learn about Queen Christina. I'm not sure what the significance of the alley that we stopped at was as I was busy talking to the German couple and the American girl from the night before, but the tour guide started talking about gender equality. Queen Christina, daughter of Gustav II, had a masculine look and grew up enjoying traditionally manly activities. Gustav II, also known as Lion of the North (I'm beginning to think that Game of Thrones was just edited version of Scandinavian history), had very liberal views at the time, allowing Queen Christina to read Catholic scriptures (in a Protestant country) and learn about sciences. Queen Christina therefore grew up like a prince, and due to her appearance and a blunder by Gustav II when she was born (apparently she was so hairy that the king thought a prince was born), maybe debated whether she was a princess or prince before she took over the throne. Caught in a controversy though, Queen Christina abdicated her throne and went to Vatican City to live out her life as a Catholic nun. I didn't really see the connection as to how that projects to gender equality in present day Sweden, but he then transitioned into how there are so many "latte daddies" in Stockholm. The whole time I was just thinking of the guy I worked with in GE on a paid paternity leave, while his wife had already gone back to work.

Swedish people are proud of their country for four things: IKEA, H&M, Stieg Larsson, and Nobel Prizes. Many of you probably already know about Alfred Nobel, his invention of the dynamite, and how he tried to rid of his title of "Merchant of Death" by creating a prestigious award (sometimes I wonder if making a foundation/scholarship after your name is pretentious or actually benefiting society but I digress), so I won't bore you with details. But if you want to ever annoy Swedish people, talk about how the Nobel Peace Prize is the best Nobel award because that one is given out in Oslo, Norway.

After the tour guide trash-talked Gustav IV for starting a war against Russia in the winter and against Napoleon at the height of his power and thereby shrinking the country significantly, we stopped by the bank where the term Stockholm Syndrome was coined. Although I've heard both Muse and Yo La Tengo's Stockholm Syndrome thousands of times, I didn't actually know what it meant or the story behind it. For those reading like me, it is a psychological phenomenon where hostages feel sympathy toward their captors. In the case of the Norrmalmstorg robbery, four bank employees and two cops were held captive by the robber. The hostage situation lasted six days while the hostages were held in the bank vault wrapped in a coil to prevent the cops from using sleeping gas (hostages will then become unconscious and fall from the stool with the coil acting as a noose and shifting responsibility of their death to the police force). You can google the full-story on Wikipedia, but the hostages ended up shielding the robber from the SWAT team and escorted him outside the bank.

Rest of the day was in the museums and restaurants. I highly recommend the Vasa Museum, the actual ship is on display inside the museum and the history behind the ship along with preservation efforts are shown well. If you happened to be there around lunch time, you can get cheap, delicious meatballs inside the museum canteen or opt for fancy dinner by the water at the restaurant by the Spirit Museum nearby.


 [![lunch](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/lunch.jpg?w=300)](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/lunch.jpg)


Moderna Museet was also interesting. The curator took the time to explain all the convoluted art and exhibits by era. The number of pieces at the museum doesn't compare to some of the larger museums (i.e. Chicago Institute of Art), but the explanations were really helpful in appreciating art from an engineer/uncultured kid's perspective.

The highlight of my day--and perhaps the entire trip--was dinner at Frantzen. It was my first time eating at a Michelin two-star restaurant. The meal is 2500 SEK (excluding wine and mandatory fika), but it was totally worth it. When you get to the restaurant, you are greeted by an old gentlemen you directs you to the seat. I sat by the kitchen, and my personal wine guide offered me an option between rich or fruity champagne to begin the night. I made the mistake of taking the drink without checking the price, and I was hit with a glass of Dom Perignon and a hefty bill. Anyways, dinner is a set menu with 12 courses excluding dessert. My personal chef handed me a cold towel as he began preparing potato with caviar topped with bacon butter. He then brought out scallop and special sourdough before sending it off to be cooked. I don't even know how to describe the food other than to say that it was simply delicious. Some of the dishes were bit salty for my liking, but that's also because I eat really bland. Here's the menu for those interested:


_pressed & creamed potato with oscietra caviar, smoked bacon butter & vichyssoise_




_poached king crab, sprouted dill, white beer, aspic & wild trout roe_




_deep-fried langoustine, dried rice, clarified butter mayonnaise_




_seared, live scallop in dashi with finger lime & spruce tips_




_satio tempestas with chicken skin and goat's creme faiche_




_grilled bread & smoked beurre noisette_




_chawanmushi, yellow onion, liquorice & almond_




_slow baked turbot, toasted creme of brown algae, carp scales & butter with bouillon of the bon_es




_binchotan grilled sweetbreads, burtn bechamel, matsutake, raw onion & fresh hazelnut_




_kagoshima vs. swedeen with truffle ponzu, dried ramson & truffle in jus of girlled beef & fermented mushrooms_




_oven baked yeast ice cream with dried egg yolk, milk stout, salted egg white & raisin syrup_




_wild strawberries, woodland strawberries & black raspberries with whipped roses tonka bean cookie & sweet tomato_




_fika - seven types of cookies with coffee_


Other than my empty wallet, everything was extraordinary.

_**Day 3**_


<blockquote>There's no rest for the weary just another day grinding up stone

Till they turn into dust, it's tough times in the rough

Diamonds ain't enough to cover up a corrupted and fucked up</blockquote>


Sometimes you just need a break. I've been blasting "No Rest for the Weary" by Blue Scholars as I lazily packed and walked around Old Town to buy souvenirs. I feel like there just isn't much to bring home. All of the Scandinavian countries have the same souvenirs: moose/reindeer, viking figures, and shotglasses. You can only guess what I ended up getting.

The Nobel Prize Museum in the middle of Gamla Stan is worth a short visit. The admission fee is relatively inexpensive, but don't expect to see much, unless you want to read through all the bios and achievements of all the recipients. In the back though, there is a nice exhibition on Hope and Biggest Influences of the recipients.

[![hope](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/hope.jpg?w=300)](https://yitaek.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/hope.jpg)

After a quick visit, you should check out a small cafe on the intersection towards the dragon figure (I forgot the name). But it's a cheap brunch/lunch place where salad bar and coffee comes with the main dish for less than 100 SEK. Also, part of their proceeds goes towards helping the homeless. Speaking of which, in Helsinki, I don't think I saw one homeless person, but they were everywhere in Stockholm.

Well, I wasn't sure how early I needed to get to the airport so I took the express train couple hours before the flight. One thing, if you fly with Norwegian Air, hiking backpacks are considered special baggage and must drop it off at a different location. Not sure why that is though...
